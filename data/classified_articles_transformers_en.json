    "content": "Mumbai: Mumbai has witnessed more than 21,000 incidents of tree falling in the last five years due to natural disasters, with 30 lives lost to tree falling. Moreover, 71 incidents of landslides claiming seven lives have been recorded in the same period between 2013 and 2018. This information was revealed in a reply to a Right to Information (RTI) query by Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh. As such, environmentalists have highlighted the need for proper maintenance of the city’s trees and regulation on illegal hill quarrying in the city. “The alarming number shows that the authorities need to be more proactive and systematic in maintaining the infrastructure as well as the environment landscape of the city so that such incidents and causalities can be prevented during natural calamities,” said Mr. Shaikh. The RTI query revealed that as many as a 21,452 incidents related to falling trees and branches were reported. In 2017 alone, around 5,714 tree fall and related incidents were recorded, while 2,869 incidents had been reported till July this year. “This is indeed a shocking number. While tree fall is a natural phenomenon, it is up to the civic authorities to ensure proper management of trees. Still, we see that many trees are left with concretised base with no space for roots to breathe. There is also haphazard trimming of trees still happening in the city, where most of their leaves and branches are hacked in the name of tree-trimming,” said Zoru Bhathena, Mumbai based tree-activist. Environmentalists have also raised concerns over degradation of hill slopes around the city due to cutting of trees on such slopes. “Most of the landslides are occurring as there is no soil left to retain the water. Many hutments have mushroomed on these hill slopes. Another reason is the illegal quarrying. Dindoshi hill has seen rampant quarrying and is still witnessing felling of trees, which is a disaster waiting to happen as it is the area where the Oshiwara river flows,” said Stalin Dayanand, project director of NGO Vanashakti.",

    "content": "Mumbai: Maharashtra needs to step up its efforts to combat air pollution as several of its cities still does not have  an action plan under the much discussed National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). A Right to Information query filed by Greenpeace revealed that none of the 17 non-attainment cities in Maharashtra, specified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for its severe pollution, including Mumbai, have their action plan to tackle the air pollution crisis ready. The non-attainment cities are those that recorded air pollutants like PM10 and NO2 beyond the standard limits of National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) over the period of five years between 2011 and 2015. The action plan deals with measures to manage the pollution from vehicles, industries and house-hold, majorly involving burning of fossil fuels. While Mumbai remains among the seven cities with their action plan submitted, the Central body had asked the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to revise these cities’ action plans, which have not been submitted yet. Environmentalists have highlighted the need for an action plan and its quick implementation ahead of winter wherein the pollution levels are observed to increase every year. Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India said, “Despite Maharashtra having the highest number of non-attainment cities, lack of even one implementable action plan raises grave concerns towards the government’s preparedness to mitigate air pollution crisis and fight the health emergency the state faces due to hazardous air pollution levels.” “All the non-attainment cities need to have action plan implemented soon, as the winter is approaching and the air pollution spike in this season as the pollutants remain for longer period in the surface at that time. We saw fog like situation in Mumbai during last winter, with pollution levels becoming as high as Beijing’s level,” added Mr. Dahiya. However, the MPCB has maintained that the action plan would be ready soon and will be implemented by September end. “We have submitted action plan of eight cities with the CPCB and those of other seven cities are being submitted on Thursday. There are only minor changes that the CPCB had asked for, which will be done,” said Dr. P Anbalagan, member secretary, MPCB.",

    "description": "Australia Issues Warning About Potential Indonesia Terror Plots",
    "content": "Australia Issues Warning About Potential Indonesia Terror Plots Arie Firdaus 2018.08.23 Jakarta Indonesian police stand guard outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta during an anti-Australia protest, March 5, 2015. AFP Updated at 5:06 p.m. ET on 2018-08-23 Australia warned that it obtained information about potential terrorist attacks targeting Indonesia and asked its diplomats to not attend a scheduled Thursday event in Surabaya, the second largest Indonesian city where suicide bombings occurred three months ago. “We continue to receive information indicating terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia,” Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in an advisory posted on its Smarttraveller website on Wednesday. “Due to heightened security concerns, staff at the Australian Consulate-General in Surabaya will not be attending an event at the Airlangga University in Surabaya on 23 August. Australian officials in Surabaya are currently adopting enhanced security measures and limiting their movements,” the message said. On Thursday, the American embassy in Jakarta followed up with its own alert about a security threat at Airlangga University. The embassy cited media reports indicating the potential threat of terrorist attacks in Surabaya and other parts of Indonesia, “including the potential targeting of Western interests at Airlangga.” “Out of an abundance of caution the U.S. Consulate General in Surabaya is closing its American Corner at Airlangga University on August 23,” the embassy said in an advisory posted on its website. A security analyst at the Indonesian Center for Radicalism and Deradicalism Studies (PAKAR), Adhe Bhakti, said the threat emerged in online chatter among supporters of the extremist group Islamic State (IS). “There was some kind of a call to conduct amaliah (code for a terror attack) in Surabaya with Australian officials who were scheduled to attend an event at a university there,” Adhe told BenarNews, without giving details. The Reuters news agency, citing two security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported that Australia’s elevated security measures were linked to a posting circulating on social media that called on Indonesians in Surabaya and surrounding East Java province to harm Australian officials. Earlier this month, Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop opened Australia’s first consulate-general in Surabaya. In mid-May, suicide bombers attacked three churches and a police headquarters in the city. At least 12 people were killed as well as 10 members of two families who were blamed for carrying out the bombings that were linked with a pro-IS Indonesian militant network, Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), according to police. Since then, Indonesian authorities have arrested more than 300 suspected militants and killed 21 others across the country. Meanwhile, a pro-IS group calling itself the Hacking Division of the Anshar Caliphate Army issued a one-minute audio message on social media in which it threatened to attack the Indonesian government. The message in English with Indonesian subtitles was read by a male voice that sounded computer-generated. The message vowed to avenge actions taken by Indonesia against Anshar’s “brothers,” such as the blocking of their social media accounts. “We will reply to everything you have done. We will fight and terrorize you in the real world and the virtual world. We will attack and terrorize you in cyberspace.” The recording’s authenticity could not be immediately verified. On Thursday, Indonesian National Police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal declined to comment on the message, saying he had not heard it. Elsewhere, a spokesman for the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) could not be reached for comment. Local supporters of IS, which was banned in Indonesia in 2014, have directed threats at the government in the past. In April 2015, a pro-IS group threatened to storm Nusakambangan, a prison island off Central Java, to free the leader of JAD, Aman Abdurrahman, who was being held there, in an audio message posted on YouTube. The threat never materialized. Aman was freed from custody in August 2017 but was immediately rearrested for his involvement in a series of attacks in the country in recent years. In June 2018, a Jakarta court sentenced him to death for masterminding terrorist strikes, including a gun and bomb attack in central Jakarta that killed four perpetrators and four bystanders in January 2016. An expert on terrorism at Malikussaleh University in Aceh, Al Chaidar, said the latest threat could be just a bluff. “There have been many threats that did not materialize,” he said. But, he added, Indonesian security authorities should remain vigilant and not underestimate the threat.

    "content": "In this Feb. 24, 2012 photo, David Daniels performs during the final dress rehearsal at the Lyric Opera of Chicago's production of Rinaldo. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) (Charles Rex Arbogast) By Martin Slagter | mslagter@mlive.com ANN ARBOR, MI - World-renowned opera singer David Daniels has taken a leave from his role as a professor at the University of Michigan after a young singer accused him of drugging and raping him following a performance in Houston in 2010. UM Spokesperson Kim Broekhuizen said Daniels agreed to take the leave of absence and that the university is reviewing the situation. \"At the University of Michigan, every report we receive, in whatever form, is taken seriously and is carefully reviewed for appropriate action,\" Broekhuizen said. \"We believe that no one should ever be subjected to discriminatory harassment or sexual misconduct. We are deeply committed to the creation and support of a safe and productive learning environment for all our students, faculty, and staff. \"We want everyone to feel comfortable reporting any such incident to the university. We believe strongly in the philosophy of 'See something, say something,'\" Broekhuizen added. The singer, Samuel Schultz, alleged in a story first published by the New York Daily News on Wednesday, Aug. 22, that Daniels and his partner, conductor Scott Walters, drugged and raped him following a performance, leaving him unconscious. Schultz claims that he awoke the next afternoon in a strange bed, disoriented, in pain and bleeding from the rectum. Schultz made the allegations public on his website, noting the incident occurred while he was pursuing his master's degree at Rice University. \"In the aftermath of confronting this reality I was faced with two choices. I could choose to become someone who felt betrayed by everything, living a life of bitterness and anger, treating the world with hatred justified by what I had to endure,\" Schultz wrote. \"The other option, and the one I ultimately chose, was to reject anger and bitterness as driving forces in my life.\" Schultz filed a complaint with the UM Police Department's special victims unit in July, UM Department of Public Safety and Security Spokesperson Melissa Overton said. Authorities in Michigan, in turn, passed the complaint on to the Houston Police Department. UMPD could not be reached for comment. Overton said UMDPSS has not received any other complaints related to Daniels to this point, Overton said. The investigation is active and no arrests have been made, Houston police told the Daily News. Daniels was approved as a professor of music, without tenure, with UM's School of Music, Theatre & Dance in May 2015.

    "content": "The new biography from Steve Jobs' daughter offers more proof that Silicon Valley is like a small town Advertisement Troy Wolverton Aug 24, 2018, 01:53 IST Joi Ito Esther Wojcicki, a journalism teacher at Palo Alto High School, was a mentor to Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the daughter of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Advertisement The new biography from Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the daughter of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, illustrates just how closely knit Silicon Valley can be. Brennan-Jobs' high school mentor was Esther Wojcicki, the mother of YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki. Esther Wojcicki is a longtime and well-respected educator. The San Francisco Bay Area as a whole may be a huge metropolitan region, but Silicon Valley can often seem like a small town. \"Small Fry,\" the new biography by Lisa Brennan-Jobs, illustrates that point. Complimentary Tech Event Transform talent with learning that works Capability development is critical for businesses who want to push the envelope of innovation. Discover how business leaders are strategizing around building talent capabilities and empowering employee transformation. Know More Brennan-Jobs is the daughter of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. After spending her early years with her mother, artist Chrisann Brennan, Brennan-Jobs went to live with her famous father as a teenager. While in high school, Brennan-Jobs got into journalism and became the editor-in-chief of her school's newspaper. Her journalism teacher, who was also her mentor, was Esther Wojcicki . Advertisement If that last name sounds familiar, it's because it should. That's because she's the mother of Susan and Anne Wojcicki. Susan Wojcicki, of course, is the CEO of YouTube, and it was in her garage that Larry Page and Sergey Brin first got Google up and running. Anne Wojcicki is the CEO of genomics company 23andMe, and was once married to Brin. To be sure, Esther Wojcicki is notable in her own right. She's a well-respected educator who has taught journalism at Palo Alto High School for more than two decades and founded the school's Media Arts Center. In an interview with The New York Times , Wojcicki praised her former student's new book. \"The dialogue that she had in there between her and Steve was just exactly right,\" Wojcicki said. \"The book is a gift to all of us.\" Advertisement The photo of Esther Wojcicki is used under a Creative Commons license .

Researchers at the University of Michigan have devised an algorithm that does a better job of identifying fake news than humans are capable of doing. The advantage is not huge. The algorithm can identify fake news about 76% of the time versus 70% for humans. It’s the speed of detection that makes the new tool valuable. Fake news often appears, ricochets around the internet, and is gone before a human has time to evaluate it. The algorithm can do in seconds what might take a  human hours to do. By the time a story has been verified or debunked, the horse is out of the barn and the damage is done. Rada Mihalcea, the computer science and engineering professor spearheading the project, tells Science Daily an automated solution could be an important tool for sites that are struggling to deal with an onslaught of fake news stories created solely to generate clicks or to manipulate public opinion. The algorithm works by analyzing linguistic characteristics like grammatical structure, word choice, punctuation, and complexity. How it got created is an interesting story in itself. Mihalcea and her team used the services of Amazon Mechanical Turk , an online service that allows people to rent the brains of other people to perform cognitive tasks — like writing fake news stories — for a fee. No need to hire someone and deal with all the hassles that go with having actual employees. Simply submit your request to Amazon, which will find people to complete the required task. Known colloquially as MTurk, Amazon apparently is not aware that name might be seen by some as a slur against people of Turkish descent. The crowdsourced team members were paid to take actual news stories and rewrite them as fake news items which were then fed into the algorithm so it could learn the difference between the real stories and the manufactured ones. “You can imagine any number of applications for this on the front or back end of a news or social media site,” Mihalcea says. “It could provide users with an estimate of the trustworthiness of individual stories or a whole news site. Or it could be a first line of defense on the back end of a news site, flagging suspicious stories for further review. A 76 percent success rate leaves a fairly large margin of error, but it can still provide valuable insight when it’s used alongside humans.” The research and the algorithm are available online to anyone interested in using them. Mihalcea says they could be used by news sites or other entities to build their own fake news detection systems. In the future, such systems could be made more accurate by incorporating metadata from the links and comments associated associated with a particular online news item. Of course, sophisticated hackers could create their own anti-algorithm algorithms designed to fool the fake news detection systems. In the final analysis, we all have to use our own judgment when assessing the things we read online. People may not be able to cry “Fire!” in a crowded auditorium, but they are free to do so online with impunity. Since the death of journalism brought on by the digital revolution, what used to be a well-tended garden is now little more than a weed-choked space where the most pernicious concepts are allowed to metastasize unchecked. The most effective fake news detector is the one located between your own ears. Whether you have solar power or not, please complete our latest solar power survey . Have a tip for CleanTechnica?

At present, people and businesses with rooftop solar systems have two choices. They can consume the energy they produce themselves or feed it back into the electrical grid. Enosi wants to give those who generate their own solar energy a third option — sharing it with others. Recently it asked Solar Analytics, an Australian software company that works with rooftop solar owners to maximize the efficiency and profitability of their systems, to conduct a survey. 350 Australian prosumers — those who produce electricity — and 350 consumers — those who want more clean energy — were asked about their attitudes regarding energy sharing. The results were startling. 90% of consumers and prosumers were interested in shared solar, with 92% of prosumers and 83% of consumers saying they would switch energy retailers to share solar. Prosumers do not feel they are treated fairly by electricity retailers and most are interested in the idea of shared solar as a way to take control of energy resources. 81% of prosumers indicated that they would rather share their excess solar energy with another person or organization than sell it back to their electricity retailer. 80% of consumers indicated that they would be interested in the idea of purchasing excess solar energy from prosumers. Enosi’s energy sharing platform allows prosumers to sell their excess solar power to consumers through blockchain-based peer-to-peer trading. It puts energy choice in the hands of households and communities rather than leaving it up to large energy retailers. Empowering prosumers will lead to lower cost and cleaner electricity for all. “This data is extremely significant because it illustrates the reality of the situation, that most people would rather support local organizations or their own communities than a commercial entity,” said Steve Hoy, CEO of Enosi. ”With this data in mind, we have great confidence in our model…..as it will help to establish a new, low cost, sustainable system for sharing and trading excess energy.” CleanTechnica reached out to Enosi to clarify a few points about how it operates. In particular, we wanted to know if the traditional grid was involved in the transactions between prosumers and consumers. Steve Hoy responded, “Yes, this is spot on. This is being done over the grid and within current regulations. This is the attraction as we can drive cleaner cheaper energy today and a lot more innovation. We need no regulatory changes. Yes, there will be grid charges – there is no way around that until you get regulatory change or most people have batteries or can use their EV’s to recharge them. “However, by concentrating on the energy retailer sector like we are, we can break the back of oligopolistic pricing, give energy customers the choice of clean energy at same or better pricing. Effectively we are allowing anyone to become an energy retailer – this is a massive game changer – small retailers can compete on price, products and services, communities can organize their own energy needs, solar farms can go direct to retail customers, businesses with large customer bases can now offer energy. ” This is a brilliant idea — putting energy producers together with energy consumers so more people can participate in the clean energy revolution. But don’t expect this idea to take off in the US any time soon. Most utility company executives would rather commit seppuku than allow individuals to have access to their grid. As America heads backwards into the glory days of coal power, any progressive regulatory changes anywhere outside the state of California will be few and far between.

German developmental bank KfW last week signed a €200 million loan agreement with India’s state-owned Rural Electrification Corporation to support the development of renewable energy in rural areas throughout India. The Frankfurt-based KfW (formerly KfW Bankengruppe) announced last week that it had signed the loan agreement with the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) which will pass the funds on to investors in the form of low-interest loans for the development of renewable energy production such as wind and solar in rural India. The loans must be accompanied by contributions of up to 30% from the borrowers as well as contributions from other banks under syndicate financing packages. When all is said and done, KfW is hoping its investment will contribute to the development of around 200 megawatts (MW) worth of clean energy which could save up to 285,000 tonnes of CO2 each year, and supply electricity equivalent to the needs of 270,000 rural homes. “India ranks third in the list of countries with the highest CO2 emissions,” explained Professor Joachim Nagel, Member of the KfW Group Executive Board . “In light of the ongoing growth in the economy and population, demand for electricity will also continue to rise. KfW’s financing to promote the increased use of renewables will make an important contribution to slowing the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the deficit in the power supply.” Germany has been involved in partnering with India’s energy sector for over 40 years, and according to a KfW spokesperson, “The overall objective is to contribute to an inclusive, technically and economically efficient, socially and ecologically sustainable energy supply and use.” According to a KfW spokesperson, the bank has an ongoing portfolio of approximately €2.4 billion, of which €1 billion “has been committed to the Indian Green Energy Corridors Programme, supporting the development of the evacuation and transmission infrastructure for renewable energies.” KfW has also provided a further €825 million “for renewable energy generation financing” such as the 150 MW Sakri Solar PV Plant in Maharashtra. “Particularly under the Indo-German Solar Energy Partnership, with which concessional funding of up to €1 billion is envisaged to be provided by 2020, additional investments are currently being prepared,” said Dr Charis Pöthig of KfW. “Further areas of cooperation will particularly focus on Energy Efficiency and Energy Distribution Investments.” There is significant renewable energy development taking place across India, thanks in part to the Government’s intention to grow renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, accounting for nearly half of the country’s energy generation capacity. Solar power is expected to dominate the future renewable energy mix with as much as 100 GW, while wind power is expected to contribute around 60 GW. Biomass and small-scale hydropower is expected to add 10 GW and 5 GW respectively. Dr. P.V. Ramesh, CMD, REC and Mr. Roland Siller, Member of the Management Committee – Europe and Asia, KfWsigned the pact in the presence of Dr. A.K. Verma, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Power and the Consul General of India Ms.Pratibha Parkar. “This is yet another step towards promoting renewable energy in India after having more than tripled our financing in renewable sector last year,” said Dr P.V. Ramesh, Chairman and Managing Director of the REC . “The partnership reflects the commitment of both the institutions towards sustainable development.” Whether you have solar power or not, please complete our latest solar power survey .

The Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development has conducted an audit of Tesla’s and parter Panasonic’s spending in Q4 2017. The office found that the combined capital investment at the Reno Gigafactory continued to exceed benchmarks set to earn state tax incentives. The news comes as a welcome positive story for the company while it rides out shockwaves emanating from recent Elon Musk tweets about potentially taking Tesla private . The audit found that Tesla spent a mind-boggling $459 million in capital at the Gigafactory in the fourth quarter, bringing cumulative capital spending up to $3.7 billion by the end of Q4 2017. The total exceeds the minimum capital investment benchmark set by the company in cooperation with state officials back in 2014 when the initial tax subsidy package was approved. If you add in the $402 million in spending for the first half of 2018, Tesla has already exceeded $4 billion in capital spending at the Gigafactory, making it clear where its profits are going for those who weren’t paying attention. On the employment front, Tesla added more than 34% more employees, with 832 new hires being added in Q4. The surge brought total enrollment at the Gigafactory up to 3,249. On top of the new Tesla employees, the Gigafactory employed 1,332 new construction workers, bringing the total number of construction workers to 13,743 — or more people than the town I grew up in. Indeed, the thought of a single facility only a few years old employing 16,992 employees is staggering and puts some scale to the work happening at the Gigafactory in support of Tesla’s Model 3 production ramp. Hiring, work, and spending at the Gigafactory must continue if Tesla is to have any shot at hitting its 10,000 per week production target of the Model 3 next year. Image courtesy: Tesla News of Tesla spending what it said it would spend and hiring as many people as it said it would hire was received positively by the executive director of the Office of Economic Development, Paul Anderson. He recognized Tesla’s diligent adherence to achieving targets set years ago, even in the face of so much change in the intervening years. “Tesla is an outstanding partner for Nevada, from surpassing their performance benchmarks at the Gigafactory to their $37.5-million pledge in support of science and robotics programs at our schools, they’ve done everything they said they would do and more. We’re very proud to have Tesla as a member of the Nevada family,” Anderson shared. Critics of the 2014 subsidy package were quick to chime in with their staunch disapproval of the 4 year old plan, alleging that Nevadans are picking up the bill on increased state spending on schools, roads, public safety, and more, but such critics illogically ignored the sizable taxes paid by Tesla in the state, not to mention taxes paid by employees working at the factory. Bob Fulkerson, co-founder and state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, sounded his tired horn yet again, relating that, “We can want Tesla to succeed and we can want them to pay their fair share of taxes and not get away with robbing the store, which is what they are doing.” This is why I could never be a politician. The highly prevalent nonsensical resistance to letting the past be the past and resistance to solving today’s problems with a long-term approach together just frustrates the hell out of me, to be perhaps a bit too honest. Tesla shared that all of the spending and new employees meant that the battery factory exceeded a run rate of 20 gigawatt-hours per year — or more than 1.67 gigawatt-hours per month. The updated production numbers make Tesla the largest battery producer in the world “by a significant margin,” according to the RGJ . For perspective, if all of those batteries went straight into Tesla’s Long Range Model 3s, the company would be able to churn out just over 22,000 Model 3s per month. With Tesla having already achieved an admittedly forced run rate of 5,000 Long Range Model 3s per week (and possibly now 6,000 per week ), the new data from the Gigafactory highlights that an equal, if not greater, amount of work than what is being put into Tesla’s Fremont factory is also being applied at the Gigafactory as it works to produce the new 2170 cells for Tesla’s products. Image credit: Kyle Field, CleanTechnica If that were only the whole story, it would be more palatable, but Tesla also needs its new batteries for its Tesla Energy products, like its Powerwall residential energy storage pack, which also has long backlogs from high consumer demand, and the much larger Powerpack. Looking at these numbers, it’s no wonder Tesla leaned on Samsung to provide the battery cells for its 129 MWh grid-tied battery installation in South Australia .

The highly prevalent nonsensical resistance to letting the past be the past and resistance to solving today’s problems with a long-term approach together just frustrates the hell out of me, to be perhaps a bit too honest. Tesla shared that all of the spending and new employees meant that the battery factory exceeded a run rate of 20 gigawatt-hours per year — or more than 1.67 gigawatt-hours per month. The updated production numbers make Tesla the largest battery producer in the world “by a significant margin,” according to the RGJ . For perspective, if all of those batteries went straight into Tesla’s Long Range Model 3s, the company would be able to churn out just over 22,000 Model 3s per month. With Tesla having already achieved an admittedly forced run rate of 5,000 Long Range Model 3s per week (and possibly now 6,000 per week ), the new data from the Gigafactory highlights that an equal, if not greater, amount of work than what is being put into Tesla’s Fremont factory is also being applied at the Gigafactory as it works to produce the new 2170 cells for Tesla’s products. Image credit: Kyle Field, CleanTechnica If that were only the whole story, it would be more palatable, but Tesla also needs its new batteries for its Tesla Energy products, like its Powerwall residential energy storage pack, which also has long backlogs from high consumer demand, and the much larger Powerpack. Looking at these numbers, it’s no wonder Tesla leaned on Samsung to provide the battery cells for its 129 MWh grid-tied battery installation in South Australia .

Illinois Governor Rauner recently signed two bills to support solar development conditions for Illinois farmers and rural areas.  They are SB 486 and SB 2591. The first creates a standard tax assessment value for local solar farms in Illinois. The second sets standards for the construction and deconstruction of solar farms on agricultural land. Lesley McCain, the Executive Director of the Illinois Solar Energy Association, answered some questions for CleanTechnica about the legislation. 1. Why is it important to create certainty around the property tax revenue that solar farms will pay to local taxing bodies? It’s important to create a level playing field for the solar industry and local communities. Establishing a statewide formula for solar farms to pay property taxes ensures that every county in the state will benefit equally from the revenue created by solar development. The law also gives solar businesses a clear understanding of their responsibilities. These standards will help solar continue to move forward in Illinois and create new jobs and more clean energy. 2. What was the genesis of the solar property tax legislation (SB 486)? The legislation was the result of negotiations between solar businesses, local school boards and taxing bodies. By working together, these groups created the framework for legislation that was passed unanimously by the Illinois General Assembly. The solar property tax legislation follows the precedent set in Illinois law for assessing the value of wind energy facilities. 3. Under the legislation, each megawatt (MW) of ground-mounted solar installed in Illinois will generate an average of $6,000-$8,000 per year in property tax revenue. Who will pay it? The solar companies that own and operate the projects will pay the property taxes. These taxes support local schools and public services. 4. SB 2591 sets standards for the construction and deconstruction of solar farms on agricultural land. Why is that necessary or beneficial? Illinois farmers who are interested in leasing land for solar now have certainty that their land will be protected during a solar farm’s operations and returned to its prior use once the project reaches the end of its life. This is an important measure that ensures that solar development and agriculture can work together. 4. What was the genesis of SB 2591? The rapid growth of solar power in Illinois raised questions about land use from local governments and agricultural groups like the Illinois Farm Bureau. The solar industry engaged with these groups to clarify how responsible solar development can create income for farmers, protect land and improve soil and water quality. These discussions helped create legislation that was unanimously approved by the Illinois General Assembly.  The solar farmland legislation follows the precedent set in Illinois law for mitigating the agricultural impact of wind farms, electric transmission lines and pipelines. 5. How will the bills help Illinois reach its statewide goal of 25% renewable energy by 2025? These laws create a clear structure for solar energy to grow while clearing potential roadblocks to development.  With good ground rules in place, we can be certain that reaching Illinois’ renewable energy goal will benefit  local economies as well as the environment. Solar is already creating jobs, low-cost electricity and new tax revenue across Illinois – now that we have these rules in place, we can expand solar’s growth in the prairie state. 6. Why is it important that land will be restored to its prior use at the end of a solar farm’s life? Agriculture is a central part of Illinois’ economy and culture. It’s important that solar developers treat land responsibly so that it will continue to produce for future generations.

    "description": "Billionaire Tom Steyer is seriously looking into running for president as he pushes to impeach Trump",
    "content": " Billionaire Tom Steyer is leading a multimillion-dollar effort to remove Donald Trump from the presidency. He is also looking into pursuing the job himself — especially if Democrats do well in elections this fall. Steyer has said publicly that he's not ruling out a 2020 run for president. But behind the scenes, the former hedge-fund chief is taking a more aggressive approach toward launching a campaign for the White House, sources told CNBC. According to interviews with six people close to Steyer, the Democratic megadonor has privately indicated he's preparing to make a decision about running. He will likely run, these people added, if Democrats flip the House and make inroads in the Senate, where the GOP holds a razor-thin majority. Pundits give Democrats good odds to win the House, but Republicans are considered likely to keep control of the Senate. \"There's no secret he's going to be running for president, especially if Democrats take the House,\" a top Democratic donor told CNBC on the condition of anonymity. \"Anyone who says this movement of his is purely about saving the country from Trump and not about any future political ambitions is just out of touch.\" Steyer associates also point to the work being done by Allen Nesbitt , the leader of opposition research firm Nesbitt Research, for Steyer's Need to Impeach super PAC, or NTI. They perceive it as another sign that the California billionaire is seriously exploring a run for president. Steyer hired Nesbitt and his team in October 2017 to take the lead on research for NTI, as well as run its rapid response operations. \"They're constantly looking at how issues that Tom works on resonate with voters — whether it be immigration, climate change, impeachment, or health care,\" Aleigha Cavalier, a spokeswoman for Steyer, said in an email. Steyer is also active in environmental issues. The firm's research inquiries aren't limited to gauging where voters stand on core issues for the 2018 midterms, according to a person familiar with Nesbitt's work with Steyer. They also appear to be measuring whether the electorate would support him for president if he ran on a platform featuring those issues. Steyer aides would not dispute that their boss is considering running for higher office but pushed back on the idea that Nesbitt's research is related to a 2020 run. \"At the end of this election cycle, Tom plans to look at the best way he can make an impact moving forward, and all options are on the table,\" NTI lead strategist Kevin Mack said after CNBC asked whether Steyer is considering a run for the White House. Mack compared Nesbitt's work for Steyer to research conducted by other groups, such as Planned Parenthood. He argued that the efforts of Nesbitt's firm aren't necessarily linked to Steyer's 2020 ambitions. Nesbitt \"has been doing research on any number of different things. Look at what the president has done at the border. Do we do a poll on that? Yes. Do we have research on that? Yes. Can the research be used for other purposes? I guess the answer is yes, possibly,\" Mack said. \"But I guess I'm saying if Planned Parenthood runs a poll about women's rights, does that mean Cecile Richards is running for president? Not necessarily.\" Nesbitt himself declined to comment when reached by phone Thursday. From the outset of his campaign to remove Trump from office, friends and supporters have noticed how much Steyer enjoys the notoriety and name recognition he's gained from the onslaught of attacks he's laid upon the White House, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. With voters growing more aware of Steyer, his allies believe that his efforts to visit different parts of the country could give him the confidence he needs to take on a growing pool of potential Democratic presidential candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are often mentioned as possible candidates. \"I think he's enjoying his notoriety and the celebrity piece to all of this,\" said a friend of Steyer's. \"He loves going on TV, going in front of all these groups and people applauding. Don't forget one final piece of the puzzle: He's been right more than not. He's been right about Trump, energy issues and health care, and those are things to consider as well.\" Steyer just wrapped up a 30-stop town hall series where he urged attendees to vote this year — and sign his petition that requests Congress remove Trump from office. Last week Steyer stopped at the Iowa State Fair with a bunch of other possible Democratic nominees for president. At the event he said he has not ruled out jumping into the 2020 election and is waiting to see what happens in the midterms to make a decision. He did not elaborate further. When asked for Steyer's comment on this story, his representatives referred CNBC to his recent comments on the matter. Steyer's suggestion that he's thinking about running for office also comes as legal peril continues to grow around Trump. The president's former campaign boss, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of eight counts of federal financial crimes Tuesday, the same day Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to eight federal charges. Cohen implicated Trump in a criminal scheme to commit campaign finance violations. Cohen's confession added some juice to Steyer's argument for impeachment. Need to Impeach immediately kicked off a $1 million national ad buy that will call for Trump's removal from office. It's not yet clear whether the topic of impeachment will resonate with voters as the midterms approach. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., has called impeachment a \"divisive issue,\" saying it's a message that should not be used by her party on the campaign trail. Polls show that voters are mixed about impeaching Trump, but that could change. A recent CNN poll showed that 42 percent of Americans support the idea of pushing Trump out of office. The poll was taken in June, two months before the Cohen and Manafort bombshells. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

One couple took their love of the film to the next level by riding Jurassic Park – The Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood a record-breaking number of times, 62, which was topped only by a marriage proposal. Check out their journey in the video above. Videos by ComicBook.com Per a press release from the amusement park, “Chelsea and Devin are local LA residents and Universal Studios Hollywood annual pass holders who have made it a tradition to come to the park and ride Jurassic Park – The Ride every year for Chelsea’s birthday with a raft to themselves which was a tradition started by Devin many years ago. They were inspired to break the record once they heard about the ride closing on September 3rd to make way for the new Jurassic World ride in 2019. “The previous unofficial record was two best friends who rode 60 rides in a row in 2015. Chelsea and Devin rode an official 62 times on Tuesday July 17th, 2018 for 13 hours with just enough break time for a quick lunch and few trips to the bathroom. The engagement ring was a custom-made mosquito amber ring inspired by the amber rocks from the Jurassic Park film franchise. The Barbasol can was a prototype officially licensed screen accurate prop replica donated by Universal Pictures for the proposal manufactured by Chronicle Collectibles and will be available for sale in the future. “They were so excited to break the record that the weekend before the attempt, they adopted a kitten and named him Dodgson while binge-watching the Jurassic Park franchise trilogy .” For those of you hoping to break Devin and Chelsea’s record, the ride closing in two weeks to be revamped for the Jurassic World attraction might prevent you from fulfilling your dreams. The ride itself began construction while the original film was still in production and eventually opened on June 21, 1996. The ride transports visitors on a river past multiple animatronic dinosaurs, ending in a massive plunge leading to an enormous splash . Once the film franchise seemingly stagnated, it seemed as though the ride would be a staple of the park, yet the revived interest in the franchise following the immense box office numbers of Jurassic World and its sequel, Fallen Kingdom , the ride is getting an overhaul with new animatronics and special effects during the nine-month renovation . Are you sad to say goodbye to the ride? Let us know in the comments below!

    "content": "Horror ‘The Predator’ Tracking for $30 Million Opening Weekend Shane Black’s The Predator is eyeing a dominant performance at the domestic box office when it […] By Charlie Ridgely August 23, 2018, 4:29pm X Facebook Shane Black’s The Predator is eyeing a dominant performance at the domestic box office when it opens in theaters next month. Videos by ComicBook.com According to early tracking numbers from Variety , The Predator is currently on pace to make between $25 million and $30 million in its opening weekend. Judging by the rest of the competition, those numbers should help Fox’s thriller easily conquer its debut. Lionsgate thriller A Simple Favor is opening on the same weekend (September 14) and it currently pacing for a $12 million to $15 million debut. White Boy Rick , starring Matthew McConaughey, is on track for just over $5 million that same weekend. The strongest competition will come from the newest addition to James Wan’s Conjuring universe, The Nun , which will be in its second weekend. The Nun is currently expected to make between $32 million and $40 million when it opens on September 7. If The Predator performs as expected, it will take home the second-biggest opening weekend of the entire franchise. As of now, Alien Vs. Predator holds the highest opening mark of the bunch, taking in just over $38 million during its debut in 2007. 2010’s Predators , directed by Robert Rodriguez, earned nearly $25 million when it was released. The original Predator film was released in theaters in 1987, and earned $12 million in its opening weekend, on its way to a grand total of $59 million domestically. When adjusted for inflation, that equals about $141 million today. Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem opened to just $10 million in 2007, while Predator 2 was the lowest of the franchise, with a $8.7 million opening in 1990. Shane Black’s new take on The Predator follows the terrifying alien race as the return to Earth, after becoming even stronger by mixing their DNA with that of other species. Jacob Tremblay’s character is the one who brings the Predators back here by accidentally setting off a strange alert. Black is directing the film from a script he co-wrote with Fred Dekker. The Predator stars Boyd Holbrook, Jacob Tremblay, Sterling K. Brown, Olivia Munn, Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key, Alfie Allen, Thomas Jane, Augusto Aguilera, Jake Busey, and Yvonne Strahovski.

    "content": "Senate Bill 320, which would require all California public universities to provide their respective Student Health clinics with Mifeprex – also known as the “abortion pill” – passed its final Committee vote in the State Assembly, making it one step closer to becoming law. The bill would require all University of California and California State University Student Health Clinics to offer Mifeprex by Jan. 1, 2022. Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus The bill passed in the California State Senate Appropriations Committee with 12 “ayes” and 5 “noes” on Aug. 16. It has now been sent to the full Assembly to be voted on. S.B. 320, which was originally introduced by California Senator Connie Leyva in February 2017, was approved by the California Senate in January. The bill would require all University of California and California State University campuses to offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022, including UC Santa Barbara. If the full Assembly votes to pass S.B. 320 with no amendments made, the bill heads straight to Governor Jerry Brown’s desk for signing. However, if the full Assembly amends the bill before it passes, the bill must go back to the State Senate for re-approval before being sent to the governor. “California law recognizes abortion as a basic health service that must be covered by Medi-Cal and by private, managed care insurance plans regulated by the state,” the bill reads. “It is the intent of the Legislature that public university student health centers make abortion by medication techniques as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible, and thus public university student health centers should treat abortion by medication techniques as a basic health service.” The bill also says that “abortion by medication techniques is extremely safe” and “staff at on-campus student health centers include health professionals who are licensed to provide abortion by medical techniques.” The Nexus previously reported that The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 that confirmed that the Mifeprex pill is safe and effective. “Oftentimes, students may not find out that they are pregnant until the fifth or sixth week, so it is vital that these services can be accessed promptly at student health centers on campus where students feel safe and already receive health care services,” Senator Levya said in a press release. “College students should not have to delay medical care and travel many miles away from their work and school responsibilities to access to medication abortion services,” she added.

    "description": "Mike Francesa, Voice Of New York Sports Radio, Enters Digital Era With CAA-Entercom Streaming Platform",
    "content": "Mike Francesa, for decades the leading voice of New York sports via his longtime afternoon drive perch on all-sports pioneer WFAN, is kicking off a new digital chapter. In partnership with  with CAA Sports and Entercom, Francesa is launching a subscription service on Friday that complements his daily WFAN show, Mike’s On . The app will offer subscribers a streaming video version of Mike’s On , though the radio show will still be available for free. It will also have exclusive extras, including football-themed shows on Saturday and Sunday, quick online-only takes as news warrants and the “Francesa 50,” a preview and recap of the biggest sports events on the calendar. Subscriptions are $9 a month or $99 for a full year, via MikesOn.com or the App Store or Google Play. (Several media outlets and Twitter users immediately pounced on the pricing, which the New York Post called “jaw-dropping.”) Anyone who does shell out will also get discounts on Francesa-related tickets and merchandise. Related Stories Executives HBO Max Is Back: WBD Rebranding Streamer This Summer News 'Jumbo', Southeast Asia's Highest-Grossing Animated Film, Wants To Be A \"Movement\" Not Just A Movie This new digital chapter, at least with WFAN in the mix, would have been impossible a few months ago. Francesa, who during the 1990s and 2000s memorably teamed on air with Chris “Mad Dog” Russo, had planned to leave WFAN at the end of 2017 — and did just that in December. Watch on Deadline After a cavalcade of guest stars and a farewell tour lavish enough to make former Yankee Derek Jeter blush, Francesa reversed himself after a couple of months and set a comeback last spring. Conversations with WFAN about a return coincided with the station being sold along with the CBS Radio stable to Entercom; morning co-host Craig Carton facing federal charges for his alleged role in a ticket-fraud racket; and Francesa’s afternoon replacements drawing lackluster ratings. “I wanted to create my own exclusive platform to provide fans and subscribers with fresh content to complement the WFAN program they have known and trusted for decades, but with a level of information and immediacy they have never experienced before,” Francesa said in a press release. “If it’s breaking news at 7AM or 1AM after a crushing defeat, fans will hear from me instantaneously.

No restrictions.” Must Read Stories Hide Articles ‘Sound Of Falling’ Review; Cruise’s Terrifying Stunt; De Niro Masterclass HBO Max Is Back: Streamer Re-Rebranding To Original Name This Summer Behind The Headlines Of The Potential Sale Of British Icon ITV Warners’ ‘Final Destination: Bloodlines’ Oozes Toward Franchise-Best Opening Read More About: Breaking News Corporate Affairs Digital Radio Streaming 4 Comments Subscribe to Deadline Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

If this confused you, don't worry -- you're not alone. Cecilia Levine Email me Read More Stories 08/23/2018 4:07 p.m. For the first time, the online platform for all-things food will have a spot in the physical realm. So, how exactly does that work? Launched in 2014 and spanning 11 countries, the site offers groundbreaking content and showcases how food fits into an infinite number of identities, customs, and aspects of culture at large. You've likely seen some of MUNCHIES' content online as much of it has gone viral (like this pizza pocket tutorial and trip to Paris with Action Bronson ) The MUNCHIES food court will be the first of its kind with a collection of vendors grouped together in a specific location, MUNCHIES co-founder and publisher John Martin told NJ.com. It will be a modern food court with room for \"experimental components.\" There will be a variety of options that draw from culinary experiences around the globe. Vendors will be chefs, restaurants or people the website has done content with before, Martin explained. The MUNCHIES food hall will feature some of the \"freshest culinary talent,\" he said. Not only will the food hall be a place for shoppers to grab a bite, but it will offer cooking presentations and other engaging events regularly for the food-enthused. There's no word yet on the vendors, but you can get a taste of what might be to come by scrolling through the MUNCHIES Instagram page.

Corey Barraclough Photo Credit: MUGSHOT: Courtesy BERGEN COUNTY PROSECUTOR Jerry DeMarco 08/23/2018 4:14 p.m. Corey Barraclough, 27, was arrested in Port Jervis on Thursday -- with assistance from Deerpark, N.Y. police -- following a raid on his East Avenue home, Acting Bergen County Prosecutor Dennis Calo said. He was charged with possession of more than 1,000 files of child pornography \"depicting nude or sexually explicit images of prepubescent and pubescent children,\" Calo said. Barraclough remained held pending extradition proceedings, the prosecutor said. Meanwhile, an investigation into online chats that authorities believe Barraclough had with girls between 10 and 16 years old was continuing in conjunction with detectives from the NYPD, Calo said. Barraclough was arrested on similar charges in 2014. The disposition of that case couldn't immediately be determined Thursday.

    "content": "Lagos: how best to sustain popular representation By : Hakeem Alabi Date: 23 Aug 2018 Share : Ambode. twitter.com/AkinwunmiAmbode There is an urgent need for Lagosians to keep vigil with the quality of their representatives across the board, from the local government to federal representatives. A situation where individuals without the right pedigree, intellect or exposure, will be put forward in a bid to protect the selfish interest of a select few, at the expense of the larger community, must be strongly resisted, if not repudiated. Lagos state is the 6th largest economy in Africa, with the lowest rates of poverty in the country and enjoys one of the highest literacy levels. It is only complimentary that with such a reputation, Lagos should be represented, especially at the federal level, by men of wit, exposure, decorum and sagacity. To think that a delegation of 5 elders, as widely rumoured and confirmed by several sources, would seek to persuade Asiwaju to back the candidacy of Bayo Oshinowo, is not only shameful but grossly bewildering. Other than the belittling bread and butter politics at the grassroots level, where representatives stifle progress in their constituency in a bid to oil the party machinery. To put it bluntly, it would be a case of lions being led by an injured sheep, if the Lagos East senatorial constituency is led by the said gentleman. To think that Bayo benefited from one of, if not, the largest dredging contract in Lagos state (Lekki and Oworonshoki axis), and would rather hire an Italian company to execute the project despite being against the Environmental Impact Assessment, while his constituents roam the streets jobless. The truth is that what Bayo calls empowerment is tokenism can barely sustain any adult beyond a day’s meal. There is hardly any concerted effort to genuinely empower his constituents with Jobs, skills or a decent education. All he cares about is using public office to serve personal interest. For what it’s worth, no one is suggesting the incumbent stays in perpetuity, but let lions replace lions. I’ll totally throw my weight behind an Abike Dabiri or a Jimi Benson, that have both shown capacity, exposure and experience but not for a man like “pepper” who has been unable to demonstrate the real capacity to lead. I’m most delighted the Asiwaju turned the 5 elders away, admonishing them to adequately prepare their candidate for primary elections. The fact that party delegates would no longer be the sole determinant of who emerges the flag bearer but every card-carrying member of the party, is arguably the most important step in transforming our political system. We as citizens must, perhaps, find meaningful ways to participate in our electoral process. Otherwise, greedy political elders would continue to undermine the quality of our leadership just like they have attempted to do with Bayo Oshinowo Related News Financial expert flays indiscipline, dearth of financial skills in govt Serving God and humanity, true purpose of life Olabode Agusto: Ambode bids farewell to illustrious son of Lagos It would be refreshing to see a debate between Bayo, the incumbent and other aspirants, on the issues they hope to influence in the national assembly, organized by an independent media. It would, however, be a no-contest as Hon Bayo can show very little for his 15 years stewardship in the Lagos state house of assembly. There might be room for someone in Kosofe, or Ikorodu to get the party nomination as they have a line of cerebrally gifted individuals. The truth is however bitter, Hon Bayo will struggle to give Lagos a strong representation and should never be considered for such a high profile job. Hon. Bayo Oshinowo has done nothing for his entire constituency. Rather, he has leveraged on a perceived political popularity to arm twist and blackmails the incumbent Governor to give him large parcels of land which are never paid for and billions of naira in contracts. No doubt, Pepe is empowered with a war chest he hopes to rely on to fund his ambition. It would, however, interest you to know that several online polls have been conducted over the last few weeks on who should be representing the Senate next year which included all the foregoing contestants, 4 out of the 5 polls had Senator Ashafa leading with more than a 50% margin. This is a testament to the fact that Lagosians are appreciative of the incredible work Ashafa has done in the past 7 years at at the home front in Lagos East Senatorial District as well as at the National Level with the delivery of critical bills such as the Nigerian Railway Bill, the NIPOST bill, his Bill to curb drug abuse in Nigeria and a host of other legislative interventions that have meaningful impact on the lives of Nigerians.

    "content": "The title of this post is the title of an impressive book by David Christian. It begins with the big bang and ends with the hope for a new universe after this one ends. Christian writes, “To understand the history of humanity, you have to understand how such a strange species evolved, which means learning about the evolution of life on planet Earth, which means learning about the evolution of stars and planets, which means knowing about the universe.” Later, he writes, “Within the creative hurricane of modernity, there is emerging a new, global origin story that is as full of meaning, awe and mystery as any traditional origin story, but is based on modern scientific scholarship across many disciplines. There are two problems with this statement. One problem is that it is unrealistic to think that many people will be able to read this entire tome, although HM has a high opinion of his readers and hopes that many of them will read this book for reasons provided later. The second problem regards the criticism that Michael Gerson offered in his review of the book: epistemological imperialism. HM likes this term and it is right on the mark. Science is extremely valuable and is largely, if not exclusively, responsible for the standard of living that most of us enjoy. But science is not the only means of knowing. No effort will be made to outline the many different ways we humans have of knowing. People can come to know God through many contemplative practices. However, a distinction needs to be made between religions and a belief in God. HM could never bring himself to affiliate with any particular religion because he was being told to believe. He reasoned that God had given him a brain and that he was given that brain for thinking, not believing. And the law of parsimony precluded belief in any specific religion. They all had problems, primary among them being that they claimed they were speaking for God. Well, God can be contacted directly through prayer, meditation, and contemplative practices. So religions are not necessary and can be bypassed entirely, perhaps for the good. When what you encounter directly conflicts with scientific findings, such as the world was created in seven days, go with the scientific finding rather than a religious book written by men that purports to be the word of God. Previous healthy memory blog posts have argued for teaching both creationism and evolution in the schools, as this provides a good means for contrasting scientific understanding with religious belief. Science can be proven wrong and the theory of evolution undergoes continuous updates. There a loads of data indicating that creationism is wrong, yet that belief persists. Schools should teach the scientific method not just conclusions from scientific research and the contrast between creationism and evolution provides a good subject area to teach a scientific method. There is so much interesting information in “Origin Story” that posts will of necessity be forthcoming. However, HM hopes that for the purpose of a growth mindset and the engagement of system 2 processes, that readers will read this book itself. And the entire book needs to be read. One can devote different amounts of attention depending on one’s interests, and can skim. But reading the whole book will provide an appreciation for the methods of science and for what is involved in acquiring scientific knowledge. It will also provide an appreciation for physical processes, biological processes, economic forces, plus an appreciation of how humanity developed and the dangers we face in the future. © Douglas Griffith and healthymemory.wordpress.com, 2018.

    "content": "News Is Your Town On The Rats And Roaches Infested And Infected Cities List Of America? Published on: January 20, 2017 at 10:24 AM ET Written By Bradley Ryder News Writer Based on the latest survey, perhaps the incoming Trump Administration can make these cities pest-free again. Every year, lists of the top cities with the most rats and roaches infestation are compiled. While it’s good to be in the top 10 of lists for tourism and industry, city officials try to avoid having this particular distinction by any means necessary. Based on current data, New Orleans, Louisiana tops the lists of cities with the most critters reported in households: Roaches, rats and mice. Bloomberg compiled data from American households to get a reflection of what cities are plagued with infestations. Because the critters can’t talk — or won’t — government statisticians asked renters and homeowners for the data. The science is not exact but is the best tool available to compile a list of cities with pest problems. The numbers and percentages are based on a person’s observation but don’t rule out or confirm exact numbers; some critters are very good at staying hidden. Hey guys, look, New Orleans is #1 at something! #NOLAPRIDE https://t.co/ZK5aeHtxOg — Make Nola Better (@MakeNolaBetter) January 19, 2017 The reports typically come out every two years and are conducted by the American Housing Survey (or AHS). It targets the 25 largest metropolitan areas around the country (15 largest cities and 10 other towns). Officials ask probing questions about the means of financing the home and neighborhood safety, among other things, and if there is any evidence of cockroaches, mice, rats and other pests. New Orleans, a port city with high humidity, is still recovering from the catastrophic damage brought on by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Not surprisingly, the Big Easy is finding it difficult to control its rampant pest problem. What city is most infested with rats and roaches? https://t.co/48dCk0c28O pic.twitter.com/43ygN6CbmF — Top Health News (@healthnews2017) January 18, 2017 According to respondents, in 2015, New Orleans led the nation with the most roaches reported in households. Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, reported the most mice and rats. Sixteen percent of New York households polled reported roach infestation and 15 percent reported having rodents. The Big Apple was the only city to be in the double digits among respondents. To illustrate NYC’s problem, the raw numbers break down to 1.1 million homes with roaches and about the same figure for rodents. Houston and Boston are also high the list of repeat infestations among American cities , according to the Patch with the latter two reporting higher densities of mice and rats. The good news is the two metropolitan areas are on the decline from previous years. The reports are in! #NewOrleans is #1 for Roaches and #Philadelphia is #1 for Rodents! https://t.co/FXGydsruan — Falcon (@FalconLawnPest) January 18, 2017 Not only are roaches and rats creepy — and embarrassing, if you have guests over — but also household insects and rodents can be hazardous to your health. Orkin describes the dangers of the American cockroach . “Cockroaches are filthy pests. They can spread disease, contaminate our food and cause allergies and even asthma. Cockroaches can pick up germs on their legs and bodies as they crawl through decaying matter or sewage and then transfer these germs to food or onto food surfaces. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), they are proven or suspected carriers of the organisms causing diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, leprosy, plague, typhoid fever and viral diseases such as poliomyelitis.” For pest control companies, the recent results are a boon to the industry and their bottom lines. If all the rodents and pesky insects vanish, so do jobs. Officials say it’s always wise to call a professional if there is evidence of a roach and rat infestation. Some chemicals designed to kill pests are also dangerous to humans. It’s important for consumers to conduct their research to find “kid-friendly” or non-toxic substances that won’t harm your health and the environment. Is your city among the top 25 for rats and roaches? [Featured image by Andrey_Popov/shutterstock] Share This Article Facebook X Flipboard Whatsapp Whatsapp Telegram Copy Link Share",

    "content": "Entertainment Jennifer Garner Took Ex, Ben Affleck, To Rehab Because It Was A ‘Crisis Situation’ Published on: August 23, 2018 at 4:17 PM ET Written By Kathryn Cook News Writer Turns out, Ben Affleck was in a lot worse shape than people had originally thought. Yesterday, the actor checked himself to rehab for the third time and many fans were shocked to see that his ex, Jennifer Garner, was the one to take him. But as more details come to light, it’s apparent that Ben was in pretty bad shape. As People shared earlier today, Jennifer visited Affleck’s Brentwood, California, home two times yesterday. The first time, Garner was alone and the second time, the actress brought an unidentified female with her, who also joined the former couple on their car ride to Malibu to the rehab facility. Garner looked visibly upset and was shaking as she left Affleck’s home the first time. A source close to the famous pair says that Garner took Ben to rehab because it was a crisis situation and something that needed to be done immediately. “It’s very stressful for her. And also devastating for her to have to stage an intervention in the middle of the afternoon, pretty much in public. But this was a crisis situation.” Another source says that while Jen is very worried about her estranged husband, her number one priority remains her three children: Samuel, 6, Seraphina, 9, and Violet, 12. “Her number one concern is the kids,” the source shared. Ben Affleck enters rehab after Jennifer Garner stages intervention https://t.co/SaC08shg31 pic.twitter.com/LfRCwoCyzp — WYFF News 4 (@wyffnews4) August 23, 2018 Additionally, the source says that Garner is now very worried about the details of her divorce from Ben. The couple have not officially signed the papers to end their marriage, but when it comes time to iron out all the details, the source says that Jen is wondering if Ben is healthy enough to have custody of their three kids and whether or not she can rely on him to co-parent. As the Inquisitr reported, Ben knew that he needed help as he has been struggling for a while now. He recently fell off the wagon and his split with SNL producer Lindsay Shookus probably didn’t help things either. “Ben has been struggling, and it got to a point where he wanted help and knew he needed help,” an insider dished, adding that “Jen has always been there for Ben,” despite the fact that they’re split up. As fans of the former couple know, Jen and Ben have remained friends as they both share custody of their three children. The couple originally filed for divorce in 2015, but as of today, their divorce has not yet been finalized. Hopefully Ben can get the help that he needs in rehab.

    "content": "ISIS Releases Purported Audio Recording Of Leader Al-Baghdadi By Sasha Ingber Published August 23, 2018 at 1:23 PM MDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email AP Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, purportedly seen here in video posted in 2014. ISIS has released a new audio recording that purportedly features its reclusive leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. If confirmed to be his voice, it would be his first recording to emerge in nearly a year . The message runs almost an hour long and was released on Wednesday by the militant group's propaganda outlet, al-Furqan Foundation, according to The Associated Press . When and where it was recorded is unknown. The recording was released as the U.S. claims that ISIS has been greatly diminished or, in the words of President Trump, \"absolutely obliterated.\" The man in the recording tells followers that he knows they're suffering from \"hunger and fear\" but to persevere. He also calls on them to topple the leadership in Jordan, a U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS. \"America is going through the worst time in its entire existence\" and Russia is challenging its influence, he says, according to the AP. He also voiced a blessing for the \"lone wolves in the lands of crusaders in Canada, Europe and elsewhere\" and called on followers to engage in small-scale attacks, according to CNN . \"A bullet or a stab or a bomb would be worth a thousand operations. And don't forget to drive into crowds in the streets.\" Hisham al-Hashimi, a counter-terrorism expert with the al-Nahrain Centre for Strategic Studies in Iraq, told NPR's Jane Arraf that the voice and manner of speaking are identical to previous recordings confirmed to be al-Baghdadi. Four years since ISIS declared a stretch of land in parts of Iraq and Syria as its so-called caliphate, the militant group has been driven out of most the territory it occupied. Last year, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Baghdadi likely was killed in a Russian airstrike on the outskirts of Raqqa, Syria. But U.S. officials believe he is still alive and probably hiding in ISIS-controlled pockets in the desert between Syria and Iraq. In 2017, the U.S. State Department offered a $25 million reward for information that leads to his capture or death. Between 20,000 and 30,000 members of ISIS remain in Syria and Iraq, according to a United Nations report in July. \"ISIL is still reverting from a proto-State structure to a covert network,\" it said, adding that \"its fragments of territory in the Syrian Arab Republic give it more options and strategic depth on the border.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

    "content": "Sign In Subscribe Now  The financial squeeze caused by doubling Medical Services Plan payroll costs next year is the top priority for local government leaders as they prepare for their annual meetings with B.C. cabinet ministers. Imposition of the NDP government’s “employer health tax” for 2019, while municipalities and other employers are still carrying employee MSP premiums at a reduced rate for that year, are pushing up property taxes. The Union of B.C. Municipalities convention in September will lead off with a resolution from Lower Mainland mayors and councillors, calling for the province to make the transition from MSP premiums to a payroll tax “cost neutral” for municipalities. The resolution notes that municipalities with payrolls of more than $1.5 million will pay the highest rate of payroll tax, 1.95 per cent, effectively doubling their payroll costs for next year. It calls for “selected tax breaks” given to private sector organizations to be extended to cities and towns. B.C. Finance Minister Carole James retreated on the payroll tax in July, announcing that school districts, health authorities and universities will still pay the tax, but their budgets from the province will be increased to cover the bump in costs until MSP premiums are phased out entirely in 2020. RELATED: Non-profits, schools get break on health tax But municipalities don’t get the break because they can raise revenues from their property tax break. Local politicians are gathering in Whistler for the UBCM convention Sept. 10-14, as most campaign for re-election to four-year terms in province-wide elections on Oct. 20. Payrolls up to $500,000 are exempt from the health tax, and as part of her July remake, James also tripled the exemption for non-profit organizations to $1.5 million, letting almost all charitable organizations escape the tax. For the NDP government, the health tax and a “speculation tax” on property value of second homes have been an ongoing battle since James introduced her first budget in February. A resolution from Oak Bay calls for the province to let municipalities administer extra property taxes, and spend the money on “non-market housing” to help lower-income buyers and renters. Oak Bay is one of the B.C. communities where Albertans and Americans have sold vacation homes rather than pay tax. RELATED: West Kelowna loses big development due to tax The speculation tax was scaled back in March to exempt rural recreation properties. The Gulf Islands, the Juan de Fuca region in Premier John Horgan’s constituency, Parksville and Qualicum Beach are being exempted. The municipalities of Nanaimo, Lantzville, Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Mission will still be included, as are the cities of Kelowna and West Kelowna, when the tax takes effect in 2019. B.C. residents pay a lower rate rate for second homes in urban areas than owners from out of province or outside Canada. The tax takes effect on 2018 property value and stays at 0.5 per cent for B.C. residents with second homes. Residences that are rented out six months or more of the year will also be exempt from the tax, which was patterned after Vancouver’s “empty home tax” to discourage real estate speculators from pushing up prices.

Aubin-Mercier (11-3), from Montreal’s Tristar Gym, is looking to shake off his first loss in more than two years. Aubin-Mercier dropped a decision to Alex Hernandez at UFC on FOX 30. Previously, Aubin-Mercier won four straight fights and seven of eight. Burns (13-3), likewise, is looking to shake off his first setback in awhile. The 2011 World Jiu-Jitsu Championship gold medalist lost to Dan Hooker at UFC 226 , which ended a two-fight win streak. Each of Burns’ past five victories have come by way of a finish. This is the UFC’s second attempt to book OAM vs. Burns. The bout was originally slated for UFC on FOX 28 , but doctors pulled Burns from the bout during fight week, claiming he was medically unfit to cut weight for the bout.

    "description": "American Airlines and Hawaiian cutting flights to China",
    "content": "American Airlines is dropping money-losing flights between Chicago and Shanghai, and Hawaiian Airlines will suspend its only route to China because of low demand.The airlines announced those and other route changes this week. The decisions reflect growing competition from Chinese carriers and rising fuel prices that have made once-marginal routes unprofitable. American, the world’s largest carrier, said it will end Chicago-Shanghai service in October. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline recently decided to cut flights between Chicago and Beijing, also in October. In a podcast on the airline’s website, vice president of network planning Vasu Raja said the routes “have been colossal loss makers.” American flies to Shanghai and Beijing from both Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth. It disclosed the latest pullback from China and reduced flights between Chicago and Tokyo as it announced additional flights to Europe, most of them limited to the summer peak-travel season. Hawaiian Airlines said in a statement it will suspend its three flights a week between Honolulu and Beijing in October. The carrier started the route in 2014 and had already downgraded it from daily service. Hawaiian said it will shift planes to other routes that fit its expansion plans. Both airlines said they were keeping alive the possibility of resuming the flights in the future. Hawaiian CEO Peter Ingram said his company still believes “in China’s future as a robust market for the Hawaiian vacation experience.” Chinese airlines have added flights and destinations in recent years, sometimes undercutting U.S. rivals on prices. Separately, the Chinese government pressured U.S. and other foreign airlines this year to describe the island of Taiwan as part of China on airline websites, a move that the U.S. carriers initially resisted. Meanwhile spot prices for jet fuel have risen nearly 40 percent in the last year, tracking the spike in oil prices. Fuel competes with labor as the biggest cost at most airlines.",

    "content": "Driving Forces  The Associated Press // August 23, 2018 // Fed official: Trump’s complaints won’t affect rate decisions  The Associated Press // August 23, 2018 // A top Federal Reserve official said Thursday that she favors two more interest rate increases this year despite complaints from President Donald Trump that the Fed’s continuing rate hikes risk slowing the U.S. economy. Esther George, president of the Fed’s Kansas City regional bank, said that she thinks two more rate hikes this year “could be appropriate” and that Trump’s comments won’t affect her policy stance. “Expressions of angst about higher interest rates are not unique to this administration,” George said in a CNBC interview. “Congress anticipated this kind of tension when they designed the central bank, and they put firewalls in place so that the central bank can be independent and carry forward with its decision making.” Her remarks came as central bankers gathered for their annual summer conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that is sponsored by the Kansas City Fed. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will give the conference’s keynote address Friday morning, with investors focused on what he might signal about the future path of rate hikes in light of Trump’s comments and economic developments. Minutes of the Fed’s meeting early this month showed growing concern about the threats created by the trade war Trump has initiated through the imposition of penalty tariffs on China and other countries. In her interviews, George said she was hearing growing worries about damaging effects of the tariffs. “Farmers who grow soybeans are concerned about the implications, she told CNBC. “Businesses that have some part of the supply chain that they think could get disrupted are raising questions about the uncertainty in terms of their own investment.” Despite the risks from trade disputes, George said she thought the economy was performing strongly and regarded further Fed rate hikes as justified. “I think two more rate hikes this year could be appropriate,” George told Bloomberg TV. In a separate interview, Robert Kaplan, president of the Fed’s Dallas regional bank, said he believed the Fed should raise rates “three or four times over the next nine to 12 months” to raise its key policy rate to a neutral level, where it is neither boosting growth or restraining the economy. The Fed’s key rate is in a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, and officials have pegged the neutral rate at 2.9 percent. That would suggest that three to four more quarter-point rate increases would lift the policy rate to the Fed’s perceived neutral level. In June, the Fed predicted a total of four hikes this year, up from an earlier estimate of three . Trump has made comments recently expressing unhappiness about the Fed’s rate hikes after having kept silent during his first year in office when the Fed boosted rates three times under Chair Janet Yellen. Trump tapped Powell to succeed Yellen after deciding not to offer her a second term. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump said he hadn’t decided yet whether he had made the right call in selecting Powell. “Am I happy with my choice?” he asked. “I’ll let you know in seven years.” A full term on the Fed board is 14 years, a duration that is intended to insulate Fed officials from political pressure. Powell has a four-year term as chairman. George told Fox Business Network that the firewalls that protect the Fed’s independence were needed to allow “the Fed to keep its focus on the public interest and the long-run nature of the economy and that’s what we’re doing.” To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here .

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump said he hadn’t decided yet whether he had made the right call in selecting Powell. “Am I happy with my choice?” he asked. “I’ll let you know in seven years.” A full term on the Fed board is 14 years, a duration that is intended to insulate Fed officials from political pressure. Powell has a four-year term as chairman. George told Fox Business Network that the firewalls that protect the Fed’s independence were needed to allow “the Fed to keep its focus on the public interest and the long-run nature of the economy and that’s what we’re doing.” To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here . Minutes of the Fed’s meeting early this month showed growing concern about the threats created by the trade war Trump has initiated through the imposition of penalty tariffs on China and other countries. In her interviews, George said she was hearing growing worries about damaging effects of the tariffs. “Farmers who grow soybeans are concerned about the implications, she told CNBC. “Businesses that have some part of the supply chain that they think could get disrupted are raising questions about the uncertainty in terms of their own investment.” Despite the risks from trade disputes, George said she thought the economy was performing strongly and regarded further Fed rate hikes as justified. “I think two more rate hikes this year could be appropriate,” George told Bloomberg TV. In a separate interview, Robert Kaplan, president of the Fed’s Dallas regional bank, said he believed the Fed should raise rates “three or four times over the next nine to 12 months” to raise its key policy rate to a neutral level, where it is neither boosting growth or restraining the economy. The Fed’s key rate is in a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, and officials have pegged the neutral rate at 2.9 percent. That would suggest that three to four more quarter-point rate increases would lift the policy rate to the Fed’s perceived neutral level. In June, the Fed predicted a total of four hikes this year, up from an earlier estimate of three .

    "content": "Thomas Cook hotel guests to be removed after Egypt deaths Published 24 August 2018 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Facebook Image caption, Mr Cooper is understood to have died from a heart attack Thomas Cook is removing all its customers from a hotel in Egypt after the death of a British couple. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, died while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Egyptian authorities said Mr Cooper was taken ill with heart problems, but the couple's daughter said the cause of their deaths was unclear. Kelly Ormerod said her parents had been \"fit and healthy\". 'Died in front of me' Mrs Ormerod, who was also at the hotel with her three children, said in a statement to Lancashire-based radio station 2BR , external : \"They had no health problems at all. \"We have no cause of death, a post-mortem is under way. \"Dad never went to hospital, he died in the hotel room in front of me. I went to hospital in the ambulance with Mum, where she passed away.\" Mrs Ormerod praised the support from Thomas Cook, which said it had received \"further reports of a raised level of illness among guests\". Image source, Deutsche Hospitality Image caption, Up to 1,600 guests are staying at the hotel, according to owner Deutsche Hospitality In a statement, Thomas Cook said 301 holidaymakers will have options for alternative hotels from Friday onwards and those wishing to go home will be flown back on Friday. It added: \"Safety is always our first priority, so as a precautionary measure we have taken a decision to remove all our customers from this hotel. \"While we understand this is upsetting for those on holiday, we believe this is the right thing to do.\" Sven Hirschler, senior director of corporate communications for the hotel's parent company Deutsche Hospitality, said there was not an unusual level of illness among the 1,600 guests staying at the hotel. He added Mr Cooper had complained of low blood pressure and was treated by the hotel's on-site doctor on the night he died. 'Tired and exhausted' Other guests have told the BBC about their experiences with illness during stays at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic. Janine Traviss, from Oldham, and her partner fell ill with a stomach bug during a holiday which ended earlier this month. \"I subsequently have been ill for several weeks now since returning and had to visit the doctors on two occasions with two full weeks of antibiotics. \"I am still recovering and still feel very tired and exhausted most days.\" Thomas Cook said it is working closely with the hotel and is supporting the local authorities with their investigations. It stated the hotel was last audited late last month and received an overall score of 96%. \"We will be contacting those customers due to travel to the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada in the next four weeks to offer alternative holiday options,\" the tour operator added. Image caption, Susan Cooper worked at the Thomas Cook branch in Burnley, which was closed on Thursday Mrs Cooper worked at the travel firm's Burnley branch, which was closed on Thursday. She was earlier described as \"loyal and long-serving\" member of staff by the company.

The leader some Democrats promise to vote against. The subject of much speculation that her grip on power is coming to an end. Nevertheless, she says she’s not going anywhere — and certainly not while President Donald Trump is in the White House. “This is not anything to make a big fuss over, it’s politics,” Pelosi said in a 35-minute phone interview with The Associated Press. “I can take the heat and that’s why I stay in the kitchen.” Pushing back on those who say her leadership position is in jeopardy, Pelosi all but dared her doubters to envision any other House Democrat sitting across the table to negotiate with Trump.

Trump and the Republicans are eager to see her go, she said, “and I’m just not going to let them do that.” With Democrats bullish about winning back the House majority, Pelosi is already beginning to lay out a detailed early-days agenda that could be set in motion come January. Beyond cleaning up corruption, lowering health care costs and providing bigger paychecks, Pelosi told AP the Democrats would push forward legislation on background checks for gun purchases and legal status for young immigrants brought to this country illegally, often referred to as “Dreamers.” “We’re ready,” she said. Yet Pelosi’s return to the speakership, if Democrats triumph, is far from assured. Dozens of Democrats — candidates and a few lawmakers — are saying they may not back her, creating an unprecedented groundswell for new leadership. “I think we’re in different territory now,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who won about one-third of the Democrats during a private caucus vote when he mounted a symbolic challenge against Pelosi two years ago. “It’s time to turn the page.” But Pelosi has faced uprisings from the ranks before, most notably after Democrats lost control of the House after the tea party Republican wave of 2010. Anyone who is counting her out — and many are trying to show her to the exits— may be underestimating her staying power. “It’s immodest of me to say, but I say to women now, ‘Just go for it.’ Tell them why you think you’re the best person to do this job,” she said. “I want to be an example to them, just to say, ‘Don’t run away from a fight.’ If you think you’re the one that should be there, you make the fight.” It’s not that other Democrats haven’t tried to replace her. Pelosi’s top lieutenant, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, has long coveted the top job, waiting out Pelosi for his moment to hold the gavel. He has been promoting himself to colleagues as a “bridge” to the next generation of leadership. Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina let it be known recently that he, too, is willing to take the helm if Pelosi falls short, lawmakers said. That prospect is appealing to many Democrats, as he would be the first African-American speaker. And younger lawmakers, including the 45-year-old Ryan, have not shut the door on running. Some say it’s time for a clean sweep, and that replacing 78-year-old Pelosi with 79-year-old Hoyer or 78-year-old Clyburn is not the generational change that the Democratic caucus wants. “A lot of new people have come in and said, ‘Look, do I have to be here 30 years before I insert myself into the leadership group?’ ” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who sees Clyburn’s potential bid as particularly influential in putting votes from the Congressional Black Caucus in play. The chairman of the CBC, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., is likely to support Clyburn if he runs for speaker. The complaints against Pelosi do not necessarily stem from her firm grip on the caucus — she is known for being direct with lawmakers, using what she has called her “mother-of-five voice.” But her long tenure has left little room for up-and-comers, and her visibility has become a liability for some Democrats. Republicans have poured millions into vilifying Pelosi in ads, some $13 million so far this election cycle, and the House GOP’s campaign arm says Pelosi provides “a top argument” for electing more Republicans. As more and more Democratic candidates and lawmakers stare down campaign ads linking them to Pelosi, some are pledging to vote against her. When the cameras turn on them during the speaker vote once the new Congress convenes in January, it’s hard to see how some of them will be able to belt out the name, “Pelosi.” Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., a vocal proponent for new leadership, envisions more of a changing of the guard than an insurrection. “I didn’t say you grab the torch out of their hands and kick them down the stairs,” she said in an interview. The missing piece in the furious behind-the-scenes chatter over Pelosi’s future is an obvious successor. Several leaders-in-waiting having moved on, and one lawmaker who had been seen as a possible replacement, Rep. Joe Crowley, recently lost his New York primary to newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “There can’t be a race when no one has declared their candidacy,” said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who joined Pelosi for a “Moms’ Summit” in her Houston district this month that drew 600 people. Some of them lined up for the chance to snap selfies with Pelosi. “She was not an unhappy camper; she was a happy camper.” Democrats are loath to start the new Congress in January with a floor fight over the speakership if they are newly in power. And many Democrats say that, with an unprecedented number of women are running for office, “it would be very unceremonial to have the first woman speaker of the House win back the house — to lead us to victory — and then not to have her be speaker,” said first-term Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. “If we win the House, I think Nancy stays, but there’ll be a transition at some point,” the Silicon Valley congressman said. Pelosi acknowledges she will not lead House Democrats forever and that if she retakes the gavel it will be as part of a transition to a next generation of leadership. Two years ago she was prepared to retire if Hillary Clinton was in the White House. But once Trump won, she felt compelled to stay — “a four-year extension,” as she puts it — to protect the Affordable Care Act, banking reform and the party’s other accomplishments. “We think the fate of the nation is at stake,” she said. ___ Follow Mascaro on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro Lisa Mascaro The Seattle Times does not append comment threads to stories from wire services such as the Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post or Bloomberg News.

    "content": "News Google Deletes 58 YouTube, Blogger And G+ Accounts Linked To Iran By Brittany Roston Aug. 23, 2018 4:15 pm EST Google has issued an update on state-sponsored activity, revealing that it has deleted 58 accounts and channels across YouTube, Google Plus and Blogger that it had linked with Iran. The disclosure comes days after Facebook made a similar announcement in which it revealed that hundreds of accounts linked to Iran and Russia had been purged. As with Facebook, cybersecurity group FireEye helped Google surface some of the accounts. READ: Facebook reveals new state-sponsored accounts meddling in politics Advertisement According to Google, both it and Jigsaw worked with FireEye over the last two months on an Iran-linked \"influence campaign\" discovered by the security firm. FireEye found three Google Plus accounts, three YouTube channels, and yet another three email accounts linked to the activity; Google disabled them. Google's own team found additional accounts that it says were linked to Iran, explaining there's evidence that the entities behind the accounts are associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). The evidence includes IP addresses, domain owner data, subscriber info, and account metadata. According to Google, the majority of accounts were on YouTube with 39 total. Another six accounts were on Blogger and the remaining 13 were on Google Plus. The YouTube channels collectively had 13,466 views in the United States; the videos are said to have contained English-language political content. Advertisement According to Google, these accounts were part of a larger IRIB organization campaign that has been ongoing since at least January 2017. This is only the latest of multiple issues Google has faced with Iran-linked activity. In 2013, for example, the company warned users of a \"politically-motivated\" phishing campaign, and it has regularly delivered warnings to Gmail users about phishing attempts originating from the nation.

    "content": "Sign In Subscribe Now  The financial squeeze caused by doubling Medical Services Plan payroll costs next year is the top priority for local government leaders as they prepare for their annual meetings with B.C. cabinet ministers. Imposition of the NDP government’s “employer health tax” for 2019, while municipalities and other employers are still carrying employee MSP premiums at a reduced rate for that year, are pushing up property taxes. The Union of B.C. Municipalities convention in September will lead off with a resolution from Lower Mainland mayors and councillors, calling for the province to make the transition from MSP premiums to a payroll tax “cost neutral” for municipalities. The resolution notes that municipalities with payrolls of more than $1.5 million will pay the highest rate of payroll tax, 1.95 per cent, effectively doubling their payroll costs for next year. It calls for “selected tax breaks” given to private sector organizations to be extended to cities and towns. B.C. Finance Minister Carole James retreated on the payroll tax in July, announcing that school districts, health authorities and universities will still pay the tax, but their budgets from the province will be increased to cover the bump in costs until MSP premiums are phased out entirely in 2020. RELATED: Non-profits, schools get break on health tax But municipalities don’t get the break because they can raise revenues from their property tax break. Local politicians are gathering in Whistler for the UBCM convention Sept. 10-14, as most campaign for re-election to four-year terms in province-wide elections on Oct. 20. Payrolls up to $500,000 are exempt from the health tax, and as part of her July remake, James also tripled the exemption for non-profit organizations to $1.5 million, letting almost all charitable organizations escape the tax. For the NDP government, the health tax and a “speculation tax” on property value of second homes have been an ongoing battle since James introduced her first budget in February. A resolution from Oak Bay calls for the province to let municipalities administer extra property taxes, and spend the money on “non-market housing” to help lower-income buyers and renters. Oak Bay is one of the B.C. communities where Albertans and Americans have sold vacation homes rather than pay tax. RELATED: West Kelowna loses big development due to tax The speculation tax was scaled back in March to exempt rural recreation properties. The Gulf Islands, the Juan de Fuca region in Premier John Horgan’s constituency, Parksville and Qualicum Beach are being exempted. The municipalities of Nanaimo, Lantzville, Abbotsford, Chilliwack and Mission will still be included, as are the cities of Kelowna and West Kelowna, when the tax takes effect in 2019. B.C. residents pay a lower rate rate for second homes in urban areas than owners from out of province or outside Canada. The tax takes effect on 2018 property value and stays at 0.5 per cent for B.C. residents with second homes. Residences that are rented out six months or more of the year will also be exempt from the tax, which was patterned after Vancouver’s “empty home tax” to discourage real estate speculators from pushing up prices.

The move is bound to attract criticism because December is a rare month off for England’s cricketers, following their tour of Sri Lanka which ends on Nov 27 and before they set off on their tour of the West Indies on Jan 11. Ahead of a summer which will contain the World Cup and the Ashes, with only eleven days in between, England players who will be engaged in both campaigns need quality rest - not a fortnight in Australia over Christmas and New Year playing for Sydney Thunder in the first half of their season. It is possible that Buttler will be England’s Test as well as white-ball wicketkeeper by then, following the injury to Jonny Bairstow that has allowed Buttler to resume his former Test position, and therefore in all the more need of a proper rest. Root is aiming for the next World T20 finals, to be held in Australia in 2020 Credit : AP Root’s objective is to improve his T20 hitting so that he can represent England in the next World T20 finals, to be held in Australia in 2020. That would be admirable, and sensible, if he were suited to all formats, like India’s Virat Kohli, Australia’s Steve Smith or New Zealand’s Kane Williamson. But Root’s primary need - and England’s too - is for him to score Test runs. And his current inability to discipline his strokeplay so that he converts his starts into centuries - he has made one hundred in his last 32 Test innings - could possibly be linked to the amount of white-ball cricket he plays. For certain, this first-class season has been Root’s least successful by a long way: for Yorkshire in the county championship and England in Tests, he has scored 356 runs at an average of 25. Quite how representing Sydney Thunder in T20 will help him to make hundreds is not clear.

The company said it had deleted 39 YouTube channels, 13 Google Plus accounts and six blogs on its Blogger website. The move is the latest step technology companies have taken against Iran after Facebook and Twitter both deleted hundreds of accounts this week . While misinformation campaigns have largely been associated with Russia, the deletions suggest Iran is following in the Kremlin’s footsteps. Google said it had uncovered links to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the country's state broadcaster, which had attempted to mask the accounts’ origins. “We identified and terminated a number of accounts linked to the IRIB organisation that disguised their connection to this effort, including while sharing English-language political content in the US,” Google’s Kent Walker said. It said it had shared details of the accounts with the US government. An example of the material shared by an Iranian-backed account Facebook revealed on Tuesday that it had removed 652 pages and accounts linked to Iran, while Twitter deleted 284. Some of the accounts, which dated back to 2011, were focused on influencing voters in the UK, and shared news backing Jeremy Corbyn and Scottish independence . On Thursday, the cybersecurity company FireEye, which had tipped the companies off about the Iranian activity, gave greater details about the campaigns. It showed how fake organisations such as “The British Left” and “Critics Chronicle” shared news in line with Iran’s interests, such as anti-Saudi and anti-Israel stories, and shared them across Facebook and Twitter. Google added that it had removed 42 YouTube accounts associated with Russia.

You’d think this would be a gift to Celebrity MasterChef (BBC One), but not once when Decker was holding crockery did anyone point out that she had \"china in her hand”. Honestly, I despair of my fellow humans. Decker was joined in the kitchen for this first heat by actor Keith Allen , rugby-player-turned-pundit Martin Bayfield, singer Josh Cuthbert (a member of boyband Union J) and TV presenter Michelle Ackerley . First they faced the mystery box of ingredients and had 50 minutes to whip up, as Aussie judge John Torode called it, “a grade plade-a-food” from its contents. Two of the quintet opted to cook chilli con carne. Decker’s was decent but Ackerley’s rice stuck together in a glutinous lump. “You know you’ve overcooked your rice when you offer your guests a slice of it,” leered Humpty Dumpty lookalike judge Gregg Wallace. The celebrities then tackled the challenge of cooking in professional kitchens for paying customers. At a towering 6ft 10in tall, Bayfield was in constant danger of braining himself on an extractor hood. Allen struggled with presentation, breaking his cod fillets and slopping on sauce like a generous school dinner lady. “It looks like a bomber has dropped my food onto the plates,” he cheerfully admitted. Michelle Ackerley tests her skills in the kitchen All five clearly relished the exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping buzz of a busy service, even though they were sweating like Pavarotti in a heatwave. For their final test of culinary creativity, it was back to the MasterChef kitchen to prepare a two-course menu of their own design. Bayfield and Decker were the comfortable standouts, even though Decker cooked a chocolate fondant dessert - a cookery show cliché to rank alongside raspberry coulis, pea purée and \"deconstructed\" puds. Cuthbert’s ambitious flavours saw him safely through, so it was between Allen and Ackerley who would suffer the ignominy of being sent home first. Ackerley was duly dispatched for the twin crimes of serving “mulchy\" lettuce and a fish pie with too much mash (is there such a thing?). It was a relief when Allen survived by a silvery, stubbly whisker because he was by far the most entertaining contestant, accompanied by a permanent frisson of danger. It felt that at any moment, he could swear loudly and storm out of the kitchen. And frankly, who hasn’t felt like that? Former rugby player Martin Bayfield towers over judge Gregg Wallace MasterChef has now been on-air for 28 years in total and this is the 13th celebrity contest. Unsurprisingly, it’s looking a little tired. At times it feels like Torode has rolled in from an all-night shift cooking in a busy restaurant, while Wallace’s waistcoat-clad gastro-geezer schtick is wearing as thin as his non-existent hair. Even the font, that Eurostile typeface which appears in the logo, captions and credits, looks a decade out of date. Yet somehow the cooking still exerts a fiendish grip. This programme is nothing if not consistent: smartly edited, slickly paced, hypnotically compelling. Slice of rice, anyone? Mulchy lettuce leaf? Suit yourselves.

It took 55 minutes for the Vega rocket to place the spacecraft into a 320km (198-mile) high orbit. Contact was then established through the Troll ground station in Queen Maud Land , Antarctica at 11.30pm. The mission carries revolutionary ultraviolet laser technology to measure the winds around the globe. It will be the first satellite to provide wind profiles that begin at the surface of the Earth and extend upwards to 30km. When fully operation the satellite will supply 64,000 profiles a day. At present this is data we do not collect, and that has been highlighted by the World Meteorological Society as a big gap in our global observation system. Controllers at ESA’s European Space Operations Centre, in Darmstadt, Germany, will now check and calibrate the spacecraft before it starts to return science data later in the year. The data will be used to make more accurate weather forecasts, and improve air-quality models that can be used to predict dust and other airborne particles that affect public health.

    "content": "Jump to content  As of Thursday, August 23, 2018 THE British high commissioner to The Bahamas has announced that two Bahamians have been awarded Chevening Scholarships to study in the UK. The 2018-19 Chevening Scholars are D'Andra Johnson and Therell Smith. Chevening Scholarships are awarded to individuals with demonstrable leadership potential who also have strong academic backgrounds, a press release noted. The scholarship offers full financial support for future leaders to study for any eligible master's degree at any UK university whilst gaining access to a wide range of exclusive academic, professional, and cultural events. British High Commissioner Asif Ahmad said, \"I am pleased to announce an increase in the number of Chevening Scholars from The Bahamas this year. This shows the UK's commitment to the relationship between our countries. \"As we look to re-opening our High Commission in The Bahamas we will continue to seek ways of strengthening our partnership through trade and education. The UK is a world leader in education and home to some of the world's best universities and I hope more Bahamian students will look to the UK as a destination for learning. \"Over the last 35 years, over a hundred Bahamians have been selected for a Chevening Scholarship and have subsequently gone on to become respected leaders across a range of sectors. Becoming a part of the Chevening network instils a strong sense of pride and responsibility. I've personally seen how this opportunity is able to transform lives.\" Ms Johnson is currently an attorney working with Lennox Paton as an associate at the firm in the Litigation Department. She will study for a LLM in comparative and international dispute resolution at Queen Mary University of London. Ms Smith is a registered nurse and now manager in the Quality and Patient Safety Department of the Public Hospitals Authority. She will pursue a master of science in health care management at Swansea University, Wales. She intends to apply all the knowledge gained to enhance the quality of care offered to the Bahamian people. Applications for Chevening Scholarships to study in the UK for the next batch are open until November 6, with applications to be submitted via www.chevening.org/apply.

The communication I shared with the prime minister and the leader of the opposition (Tuesday) morning was that there were two outstanding (senators) who had not submitted their declaration of which he instructed me with regards to dealing with those two.\" When asked if he will give Attorney General Carl Bethel information about those who missed the March 31 deadline but have since filed their disclosures, Mr Laroda said he did not yet know. PLP Leader Philip \"Brave\" Davis previously said the PDC should provide information to the Attorney General's Office about all officials who missed the deadline for disclosures, not just those with outstanding disclosures as of Tuesday.

( Supplied: National Archives of Australia ) abc.net.au/news/push-for-remembrance-day-and-formal-apology-coniston-massacre/10157304 Link copied Share Share article On the eve of the 90th anniversary of the Coniston Massacre — Australia's last state-sanctioned mass killing — an Aboriginal leader has called for a national day of remembrance, like Anzac Day, to commemorate massacres of Indigenous people. Key points: Ceremony in central Australia to commemorate the 1928 Coniston Massacres 31 people were killed in the frontier war, but Indigenous people say the true number is closer to 100 Indigenous leaders want a formal apology from NT Police, amid renewed push for a national day of remembrance A ceremony in Yurrkuru — formerly known as Coniston Station — on Friday will remember the Coniston massacres in 1928, in which dozens of Indigenous people were killed. An official report found 31 people were killed, but local Indigenous people say the true number was closer to 100. Chairman of the Central Land Council Francis Kelly said many people did not know anything about the massacres, which took place over two months. \"It's like Anzac Day, like memories of people who've been in war,\" he said. \"This is similar to our people and some people in urban areas don't know much about Coniston Massacre. \"Now we want to bring it to the world to know about it.\" Frances Kelly said many Australians were unaware of the Coniston Massacre. ( ABC News: Steven Schubert ) The massacres began in August 1928 after a dingo trapper, Fred Brookes, was killed by a local Indigenous man. Police Constable George Murray led a party and personally admitted to killing at least 17 people. NT Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw will attend the commemoration, and some descendants of those who were killed are hoping he will offer a formal apology. But Mr Kelly said he wanted more than just words. \"That's alright to say sorry but it's more deeper than sorry today,\" he said. \"Proper [progress] comes from justice from the Government and the police too. \"And today it's still going on in the background, people still getting killed, even in jail.\" Constable Murray's grand-niece Liza Dale-Hallett will attend the commemoration ceremony, and agreed that there should be better recognition of the frontier wars between Indigenous Australians and white settlers. \"This is our Australian story, this is how we respond and how we respect and honour the really difficult parts of our past,\" she said.

( Supplied: National Archives of Australia ) \"It is a really important part of, I think, us becoming mature as a nation and opening our hearts to others who really have suffered and continue to suffer.\" Mr Kelly said he welcomed representatives of Constable Murray's family attending the commemoration. \"It's good to have them there and have a relationship with each other today, to care for each other, but this one is just the past,\" he said. \"We can talk about past but let's forget about it and be in one. \"I think we should all come together and be in harmony.\" Posted Thu 23 Aug 2018 at 8:31pm Thursday 23 Aug 2018 at 8:31pm Thu 23 Aug 2018 at 8:31pm , updated Fri 24 Aug 2018 at 1:40am Friday 24 Aug 2018 at 1:40am Fri 24 Aug 2018 at 1:40am Share options Copy link Facebook X (formerly Twitter) News in Language Listen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and Kriol Listen Top Stories Erin Patterson jury shown footage of accused killer dumping food dehydrator Topic: Law, Crime and Justice Photo shows A police officer inspects plastic bins at Koonwarra tip near Leongatha.

The dispute escalated and one of the men pulled out a gun and started firing at the other man. He missed his target, Williams said, and instead struck the victim who was at a house in the area. The victim, also a black male, was struck in the back and taken to UAB Hospital. His injuries are serious. The suspect, whose name has not yet been released, fled the scene but was captured by Birmingham police about one block away. Police said he was captured when he ran out the back door of a home on Inglenook Street. Several witnesses were also being questioned. The investigation is ongoing.

Their insane brand of comedy, while appealing to absolutely everyone, has a particularly resonant tone right now. We are thrilled Carolyn, Meredith, Aurora and Jennifer will be returning to IFC for a fourth season in 2019.” Baroness von Sketch Show is executive produced by Jamie Brown, Taylor, MacNeill, Browne and Whalen.

By Washington Post UPDATED: August 22, 2019 at 10:02 AM CDT What the Democratic National Committee this week thought was an attempted hack of its valuable voter file turned out to be a security test organized by a state party, unbeknown to the national organization. The committee on Tuesday alerted the FBI to a fake online portal it thought had been set up as an elaborate attempt to trick DNC staff into giving up their log-in credentials — through a hacking technique known as “phishing” — as a way to gain access to the party’s VoteBuilder database. Late Wednesday night, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord reversed course. “We, along with the partners who reported the [fake] site, now believe it was built by a third party as part of a simulated phishing test on VoteBuilder,” he said in a statement. The false alarm raised fears that the DNC was being targeted again by a malicious foreign government, as it came two years after Russian spies hacked its computers and released thousands of emails online, throwing the party into disarray in the midst of a presidential election. Election security is a hot topic, and the Trump administration is facing criticism that it has not done enough to safeguard the November midterm vote. The mix-up resulted from a state Democratic organization seeking to test employees’ ability to avoid falling prey to phishing attempts. The test was conducted at the behest of the Michigan Democratic Party, using “white-hat” security personnel with the group DigiDems, who provided their services to create the mock site, a Democratic official said. The state party did not notify the national committee or NGP, the firm that hosts the voter database, the official said. “The test, which mimicked several attributes of actual attacks on the Democratic Party’s voter file, was not authorized by the DNC, VoteBuilder nor any of our vendors,” Lord said. The mock site was discovered by a San Francisco-based security firm, Lookout, which has built a system that scours the Internet for such sites. Lookout contacted DigitalOcean, the firm that hosted the fake site. NGP also was informed. Shortly after midnight Tuesday, Lookout alerted Lord. After some investigation, all concurred that the site appeared to be a system set up for malicious purposes, a party official said. It did not exhibit features of a phishing test system, the official said. Phishing tests usually have a page that informs users they should not have clicked on a link and an online tutorial on recognizing phishing scams, the official said. Michigan party officials told the DNC on Wednesday afternoon that they had ordered the test. They were “a little embarrassed, but they did the right thing and told us right away,” said a DNC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter remains sensitive. “They didn’t let it linger.” Lord said he’s not seeking to punish anyone. “I’m not interested in slowing down people who want to do legitimate and appropriate testing,” he said in an interview. But the national party is likely to issue guidance, he said, “which is if you’re building any sort of attack framework, white-hat testing, we need to be aware of that so we can factor that into our decision-making.” Published by Washington Post .

    "content": "By ASSOCIATED PRESS and SNEJANA FARBEROV FOR DAILYMAIL.COM Published: 18:44 BST, 23 August 2018 | Updated: 22:09 BST, 23 August 2018  207 View comments  A Missouri mother has been charged with prostituting her severely disabled 14-year-old daughter with the mental capacity of a toddler in exchange for money and cocaine. Renee Collins, 49, of Columbia, was charged on Tuesday with second-degree trafficking of a child and first-degree child endangerment. Her boyfriend, 44-year-old William Thomas Jr, of Rocheport, was charged with first-degree rape. They are both jailed in Boone County. Sex trafficking: Renee Collins, 49 (left), has charged with second-degree trafficking of a child and first-degree child endangerment. Her boyfriend, 44-year-old William Thomas Jr (right), has been charged with first-degree rape Police were tipped off last year that Collins' severely disabled daughter was being left in a room at The Welcome Inn in Columbia, Missouri, with strange men for long periods of time Court records say Collins' daughter has cerebral palsy and autism, and she is also partially deaf and uses corrective leg braces. She was taken into protective custody in July 2017 and told authorities that her mother would 'loan' her to 'bad men,' including Thomas. According to a probable cause affidavit cited by ABC17 , law enforcement officials launched an investigation into Collins and her boyfriend after getting a report from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, saying that a teenage girl was being left in a room at The Welcome Inn on North Providence Road in Columbia with strange men for long periods of time. When she was taken into protective custody, the teen said her mother (pictured) would 'loan' her to 'bad men,' including Thomas The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children learned of the suspected child sex trafficking from the regional manager of The Welcome Inn hotel, where staff had become concerned for the teenager's safety. A witness then came forward on July 7, 2017, telling police that Collins had been offered cocaine in exchange for allowing two men to have sex with her severely impaired daughter. Once she was taken into protective custody, the victim told investigators that at least on one occasion, 'bad men' inserted a needle into her arm and injected her with 'medicine' after sex, according to the station KOMU . The girl, who according to a caseworker has the mental capacity of a 2- of 3-year-old child and requires constant care, also allegedly accused Thomas of sexually assaulting her. Collins and her boyfriend were booked into the Boone County jail on Wednesday evening and their bond was set at $200,000 each. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

You've probably added a few new flannels to your shopping cart already, and are counting down the days until Starbucks starts selling Pumpkin Spice Lattes again. It's safe to say you've fallen hard for fall and all of the activities that come along with it. Whether you're headed to the pumpkin patch with your bae or a winery with the girls, be sure to pack some clever autumn puns for Instagram to pair with your pics when it’s time to post. Not too long ago, you were laying on the sand on your favorite beach towel. However, it's hard to miss summer when you're about halfway through that first hayride with your besties and feel that cool breeze in the air. Oh, and the leaves on the ground have miraculously become the best prop for your Instagram, especially paired with your cute new fall boots. (Thanks, Mother Nature.) At least, that's exactly what your plandids are portraying when you snap a pic tossing dozens of leaves into the air. \"Back to the basics\" is an understatement when it comes to fall, and the same thing applies when it comes to coming up with the perfect fall pun for Instagram. Everyone is living their best lives doing the same seasonal shenanigans they did last year. How could you not want to repeat those hot cocoa and s'mores outings over and over again? The best part about the fall season is all of the festive activities that come with it, and no matter how old you are, it never gets old. Literally every autumn activity makes for an entertaining scroll session when you're exploring your feed. Don't let anyone interrupt your basic fall joys. Whether you’re into posting Instagram Reels or carousel IG posts with a handful of your favorite pics, you can use any of these 36 autumn puns as Instagram captions to tell anyone who tries to ruin your fun to \"bow down, witches.\" hobo_018/E+/Getty Images \"I have a feeling I'm going to leaf you smiling.\" — Unknown \"This hayride is my new autumn-mobile.\" — Unknown \"My love for fall is autumn-atic.\" — Unknown \"Don't be a basic witch.\" — Unknown \"Oh my gourd!

    "content": "Justin Bieber ’s fiancée, Hailey Baldwin , is showcasing that big rock on her finger for the September cover of Vogue Mexico ! In the black-and-white image, the blonde bombshell casually rests her head on her arm while leaning on a counter – displaying her left hand for all the world to see -- while sporting a tweed jacket and wearing her short locks down. In July, ET spoke with Jack Solow of Solow & Co. Inc. Diamond Jewelers, the man behind the ring, to explain how the stunning piece came together . “I was very happy that Scooter [Braun, Bieber's manager] said I was really going to take care of this ring for Justin,” he said. “Justin’s team gave me a heads up that I was the guy that was going to be doing Justin’s ring for Hailey. They were pretty specific about what Justin wanted in the sense of design and metal and left it for me to suggest certain shapes of stones and types of stones.\" \"I presented the team that then passed it on to Justin,” he added. “I gave him lots of different choices. Justin was really interactive. ‘No to this. Kind of like this. Can we have it a little bit longer?’ We settled on a beautiful, elongated oval. The ring is gorgeous. It is what Hailey wanted.\" Clearly this wasn’t a hasty decision on the part of the pop star. Bieber asked for the 21-year-old model’s hand in marriage while they were vacationing together in the Bahamas. The “What Do You Mean?” crooner got down on one knee and proposed in the restaurant of the resort where they were staying, according to TMZ . ET has since learned that the couple intends to take things slow and enjoy their engagement rather than rushing to the altar. “The couple have talked to a lot of people close to them, and are listening to the constant advice they’ve been receiving to ‘enjoy the ride,’\" a source shared. \"[They are] in a loving relationship and are working on the foundation now to maintain the forever.\" Get more news on Baldwin and Bieber in the clip below.

If this confused you, don't worry -- you're not alone. Cecilia Levine Email me Read More Stories 08/23/2018 4:07 p.m. For the first time, the online platform for all-things food will have a spot in the physical realm. So, how exactly does that work? Launched in 2014 and spanning 11 countries, the site offers groundbreaking content and showcases how food fits into an infinite number of identities, customs, and aspects of culture at large. You've likely seen some of MUNCHIES' content online as much of it has gone viral (like this pizza pocket tutorial and trip to Paris with Action Bronson ) The MUNCHIES food court will be the first of its kind with a collection of vendors grouped together in a specific location, MUNCHIES co-founder and publisher John Martin told NJ.com. It will be a modern food court with room for \"experimental components.\" There will be a variety of options that draw from culinary experiences around the globe. Vendors will be chefs, restaurants or people the website has done content with before, Martin explained. The MUNCHIES food hall will feature some of the \"freshest culinary talent,\" he said. Not only will the food hall be a place for shoppers to grab a bite, but it will offer cooking presentations and other engaging events regularly for the food-enthused. There's no word yet on the vendors, but you can get a taste of what might be to come by scrolling through the MUNCHIES Instagram page.

    "content": "Carriers How to Cancel T-Mobile & Leave for Good Published 8 years ago on 12/14/2016 By Travis Pope T-Mobile’s Uncarrier moves have had a huge impact on the wireless industry in the United States. Shortly after it failed to merge with AT&T, T-Mobile began refashioning itself as the ultimate place for those that didn’t want to be taken advantage of. It stopped tying the sale of smartphones to two year contracts with Early Termination Fees. It announced unlimited music streaming and gave people on certain plans the option to keep their unused high-speed data for up to a year. It also eliminated bill overages. There’s a lot of reasons you’d want to switch to T-Mobile. It’s not that hard to find reasons to want to cancel T-Mobile either. For all its talk of freeing users from contracts, it’s not really doing that. It knows that the many of its users will want the latest iPhone or Android device, and they won’t want to pay its real price. They’ll gladly sign up for Jump On-Demand leasing that requires some financial pain to get out of. T-Mobile’s LTE network has improved a great deal, but there are still dead spots in smaller cities where you get little to no reception. Rural areas are still a challenge for the carrier too. If you’re ready to cancel T-Mobile, here’s what you need to know. How to Cancel T-Mobile: What You Need to Get Started For the best experience cancelling T-Mobile, you’re going to want to do a bit of planning. Start by having a copy of the last bill that the carrier sent to you. If you use digital billing for the company, you can find that bill in the My T-Mobile area of the company’s website. What you’re looking for on that bill is your account information and an idea of what you’ll need to pay to leave the carrier. As with the other wireless companies, it’s a good to pay off whatever remaining bill balance that you have with them while you’re cancelling. You’ll be asked to do so later if you don’t, plus the carrier has the right to refuse to unlock your phone if you don’t. It’s important to know how you’re paying for your phone. Look on your bill for EIP or Jump-On Demand. EIP stands for Equipment Installation Plan. With an EIP, you’ve financed a phone purchase through T-Mobile. When you cancel, you’re only on the hook for the remaining amount that’s left to pay out on your phone and any bill. There’s no termination fee. Jump On-Demand is a bit more complicated than that. The phone that you have isn’t yours. It was never yours to begin with. T-Mobile simply leased it to you. The company doesn’t expect Jump On-Demand customers to stick with a device longer than a year, which is how long it takes to get close to paying it off. When staying on the network, you can only get out of a Jump On-Demand lease by fulling the amount of payments on the lease and upgrading, exercising the buy-out option on your lease, or turning in the device. If you’re canceling a Jump On-Demand lease before your lease term is up, you’ll need to pay the amount of lease payments you have left, according to T-Mobile Support. You can also find this in the My T-Mobile area under billing. You’ll have to turn in your device, and you could be charged for any access wear that’s happened to the device in your care. Jump On-Demand users will then need to exercise the payment option in their lease to buy their phone and take it with them to their new carrier. That amount is outlined on My T-Mobile too. To give you an idea of how much using that purchase option can cost, for the iPhone 6s with 32GB of storage, it’s $182. How to Cancel T-Mobile: Calling in to Make the Cancellation To cancel T-Mobile, you can call 1-877-453-1304 or head into your local store. You’ll want to use the support number only if your purchased your phone through an installation plan or EIP. Those that used Jump On-Demand need to visit a retail store to cancel T-Mobile. That’s because the carrier needs to inspect your phone if you’re planning on turning it in rather than using your purchase option to keep it and unlock it for another carrier. T-Mobile iPhone 6s upgrade details you need to know. Be sure to have any information that you need on-hand, like your bill so that you have your account number and such. The calling agent will walk you through how much your final payment will be and anything keeping you from taking your smartphone with you. How to Cancel T-Mobile: Fees, Charges & Costs You Can Expect Again, because T-Mobile’s programs are intricate, it’s hard to give a definitive prediction of cancellation costs. EIP users should only be asked to pay their last month’s bill and whatever amount is left on their installation plan. Jump On-Demand users can expect to pay their last month’s bill and any lease payments left on their device. They’ll also be asked to give back their device or pay more to purchase it outright. How to Cancel T-Mobile: Taking Your Phone with You Taking your phone with you when you cancel T-Mobile is mostly straight forward. T-Mobile Support outlines the carrier’s policy on unlocking devices. Read: How to Unlock Your T-Mobile Phone: Requirements & Options The carrier says it won’t unlock any device that has been reported lost or stolen. The account associated with the device must be paid up in full, and you can’t have asked for more than two unlock codes from the carrier in the last year. Additionally, you need to have had the device on T-Mobile for at least 40 days. Finally, you need to have paid for your EIP or Jump-On Demand lease in full. The phone area at the My T-Mobile website lets you check the unlock status of your device. Your call center representative will walk you through the final steps in unlocking your device, or explain to you why your device can’t be unlocked. Because T-Mobile is a GSM carrier, your phone will work on AT&T and any virtual carrier that uses AT&T or T-Mobile’s network. Good look trying to cancel T-Mobile.

US attorney general Jeff Sessions has hit back at Donald Trump following the president’s latest attack on him. Mr Trump has lashed out repeatedly at Mr Sessions over his running of the Department of Justice (DOJ), and in his latest criticism he claimed Mr Sessions had “never taken control” of the unit. Mr Sessions was the first senator to endorse the celebrity businessman but then excused himself from the special counsel investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. In an interview aired on Thursday, Mr Trump said of Mr Sessions: “You know the only reason I gave him the job? Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter.” He then went on to condemn Mr Sessions’s running of his department. But hours later, the Attorney General hit back, insisting he “took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the president’s agenda”. He also declared that while he is attorney general, “the actions” of the DOJ “will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action”. Share Get involved with the news Send your news & photos Loading... Show more articles",

    "content": "A Linaro spinoff called Foundries.io unveiled a continuously updated “microPlatforms” IoT service with managed Linux and Zephyr distros. The Linux platform is based on OE/Yocto and Docker container code. A Cambridge, UK based startup called Foundries.io, which is funded by Linaro, has launched a microPlatforms service with managed, subscription-based Linux and Zephyr distributions. The microPlatforms offering will target IoT, edge, and automotive applications, and provide continuous over-the-air (OTA) updates to improve security. Linaro CEO George Grey also serves as CEO of Foundries.io. The distributions are designed to work with any private or public cloud platform, with the microPlatform cloud service acting as an intermediary. The microPlatforms packages include firmware, kernel, services, and applications, “delivered continuously from initial product design to end-of-life,” says Foundries.io. Linux microPlatform architecture (click image to enlarge) Benefits from microPlatforms include improved security, lower development costs, and “faster time-to-market for products across a wide range of IoT connected devices,” says the company. There’s also a combined Linux/Zephyr offering that bridges both sides of the IoT architectural divide designed for projects that include both a Linux gateway/edge device and Zephyr controlled sensor devices. — ADVERTISEMENT — Subscriptions range from $10 per month for evaluation and non-commercial use to $10,000 or $25,000 per year for professional Zephyr and Linux packages, respectfully. There are no per unit fees, and Foundries.io notes: “We regularly upstream our open source work; you can end your subscription any time and keep using the software.” There’s also a community website with forums and support services. Linux microPlatforms The Linux microPlatform (LmP) supports support Arm, Intel, and RISC-V based devices. The initial targets include the Raspberry Pi and several 96Boards (see farther below). LmP starts with a minimal Linux distro built with OpenEmbedded/Yocto and “a recent stable kernel.” The distribution is designed to be compact and resource efficient, with minimal attack surfaces. Linux microPlatforms with containers (click image to enlarge) The Linux stack includes secure updatable firmware and a Docker container-based application runtime with reference container Dockerfiles and images. Source code is available, and you can also download binaries for supported target boards. The use of containers is optional, as you can also run LmP natively. LmP also includes a cloud management service, which offers a “continuously tested and stabilized stream of updates,” says Foundries.io. The platform lets you “securely and remotely manage your product’s software” using standard tools such as Ansible and Kubernetes. The initial LmP targets include: Zephyr microPlatforms The Zephyr microPlatform is the first downstream distribution for the Linux Foundation hosted, open source Zephyr RTOS . ZmP builds on the Zephyr RTOS foundation with “MCUboot software, services, and reference applications to provide a continuously tested, secure, updatable, cross-architecture solution for microcontroller-based products,” says the startup. Zephyr microPlatform architecture (left) and combined Linux and Zephyr microPlatform (click images to enlarge) The Zephyr stack supports all the hardware listed by the Zephyr Project, including products from Nordic Semiconductor, NXP, and STMicroelectronics. This week, the Zephyr Project announced an expansion of support to 100 boards, including Arduino-compatible HiFive1 and Arduino Cinque boards, and the BBC Microbit and 96Boards Carbon. Supported SBCs that primarily run Linux but can also run Zephyr on their MCU companion chips include the MinnowBoard Max, Udoo Neo, and UP Squared. Toradex and Linaro partnerships Foundries.io’s launch partners are Toradex and Linaro — the open source code development organization backed by Arm and several of its major licensees. Linaro will offer microPlatforms support for its 96Boards SBCs. Toradex, whose Colibri iMX7 is a target platform, is “using the Linux microPlatform as a secure and updateable base for its upcoming software offering,” says Foundries.io. Toradex CTO Roman Schnarwiler adds: “Toradex will be announcing exciting news about our upcoming software offerings for our SoMs, based on the Foundries.io Linux microPlatform soon.” Also today, Toradex announced a software development partnership with The Qt Company . Toradex will provide the Qt development platform on its modules including Qt Device Creation. It will also Boot2Qt with Toradex Easy Installer. OTA and containers in IoT Continuous OTA updates are widely seen as one the best ways to improve IoT security. OTA is central to several recent IoT frameworks, including Google’s recently announced Cloud IoT Edge for devices equipped with its new Edge TPU machine learning co-processor chips. OTA is also central to Microsoft’s secure, Linux-based Azure Sphere IoT platform, which was further detailed today at the Hot Chips 2018 conference. Container technology, meanwhile, is seen as a way to ease embedded Linux remote management and automated updates. For example, Resin.io provides an embedded Linux container technology with its OTA-enabled ResinOS . Canonical’s Ubuntu Core also uses a container-like scheme to provide transactional updates. Further information The Foundries.io microPlatforms subscriptions are now available, ranging from $10 per month for evaluation and non-commercial use to $10,000 or $25,000 per year for professional Zephyr and Linux packages, respectfully. Downloads of microPlatforms source code, binaries, and documentation are available at the Foundries.io website .",

The 39-year-old beauty had a bar over her chest that read 'good wife' and insisted she was only promoting stylist Steph Shepherd's J-brand jeans. The timing is interesting as only hours earlier her ex Younes Bendjima, 25, was seen in a video attacking a man outside a West Hollywood club back in March. Racy lady: Kourtney Kardashian posed topless while modeling skintight jeans and high heels in her walk-in closet on Thursday TMZ shared the clip of the model hitting a Delilah employee over and over outside the back of the club. The clip was released for the first time on Thursday even though it is already five months old. Rapper Drake and NFL star Odell Beckham Jr were among the group who left through the back door of the club when the encounter occurred. No shirt required: The 39-year-old beauty wrote on the image that she was a 'good wife' and was only promoting stylist Steph Sheperd's jeans Video released: This post comes after news Younes Bendjima, 25, attacked a man outside a club in Los Angeles in a new video released on Thursday; (pictured in July in Italy) In the video, the employee is seen opening the back door from the alley as words are exchanged and Bendjima delivers four punches to the employee's head. Another member of the entourage joins in with his own punches as the victim appears to fall down. Drake was part of the group who at the club when the encounter occurred; (pictured July) Bendjima grabs the victim by the hair and continues to punch him. Beckham Jr can be seen watching the attack happen a few feet back behind the group of men. At the end of the video, Drake can be seen walking up behind Beckham Jr., look towards the attack, and turn around back into the club. A source told TMZ that the employee 'talked smack' to the group after he opened the back door to the alley. Law enforcement told TMZ that the employee filed a police report but ended up not pursuing the matter. Kardashian and Bendjima broke up after a recent holiday to Italy where they looked very much in love. The split came amid cheating claims and now according to People , Kardashian has 'cut off all contact with him.' Brutal: In the video, the employee is seen opening the back door to alley as words are exchanged and Bendjima delivers four punches to the employee's head; here Younes is seen 'Kourtney is doing great' and 'happy being single for now,' said a different insider, insisting: 'She isn’t seeing Younes. After all the drama with Scott over the years, she wasn’t going to put up with any drama from Younes.' The couple had been dating for almost two years and was Kardashian's first public relationship following her split from Scott Disick who she was with for nine years and shares children Mason, eight, Penelope, six, and Reign, three. Bendjima was born in Lyon, France - where his father ran a traditional Algerian restaurant - before moving to the United States where he studied boxing. He made his modeling debut for Givenchy while walking in Riccardo Tisci’s men's runway show in the spring of 2013. Better days: The couple had been dating for almost two years and was Kourtney's first public relationship following her split from Scott Disick Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

Confira a FICHA do Olympiakos-Burnley A equipa do Pireu ganhou vantagem de bola parada, aos 19 minutos, num livre direto, com a assinatura de Konstantinos Fortounis. No entanto, a vantagem da equipa grega durou pouco mais de dez minutos, uma vez que o Burnley acabou por empatar, na sequência de uma grande penalidade convertida por Chris Wood. A equipa grega acabaria por recuperar a vantagem, logo a abrir a segunda parte, mais uma vez de bola parada: livre sobre a direita, com Andreas Bouchalakis a surgir junto ao primeiro poste para desviar de cabeça. À passagem da hora de jogo, Ben Gibson cortou uma bola com a mão na área, viu um segundo cartão amarelo e o consequente vermelho e permitiu que Fourunis bisasse no jogo, na transformação da grande penalidade.
