The theme of this year’s invite-only event is “Build Beyond,” and Facebook said in a blog post , “It’s an invitation to be bold in how we build and grow at a time when products, people and ideas change faster than ever. It’s our call to take risks, and to take them together—knowing that when we dare to go big, we can accomplish amazing things.” The social network said the first day of this year’s Global Partner Summit will focus on current products and solutions and explore insights about customer segmentation and various verticals. Day two will be geared toward looking ahead and exploring where opportunities exist to “Build Beyond.” Keynote David Cohen @9Number9 davidjcohen9@gmail.com David Cohen is a freelance writer for ADWEEK, covering breaking news.

    "description": "Comment on Microsoft will never again sneakily force Windows downloads on users by Michael Weyant",
    "content": " There have been various controversies with Windows 10, from issues with privacy and telemetry, to ads and forced upgrades. Following a court case, Microsoft has vowed to never force upgrade files onto users again. Windows users in Germany were particularly unimpressed when Microsoft forcibly downloaded many gigabytes of files to upgrade from Windows 7 and 8 to Windows 10. Having held out for 18 months, and losing its case twice, Microsoft has finally agreed to stop its nefarious tactics. After a lengthy battle with Germany's Baden-Würtenberg consumer rights center, Microsoft made the announcement to avoid the continuation of legal action. A press release on the Baden-Würtenberg website reveals that Microsoft has announced it will no longer download operating system files to users' computers without their permission: Microsoft will not download install files for new operating systems to a user system’s hard disk without a user's consent. The consumer rights center hoped for this resolution to be reached much sooner, but Microsoft's decision will please the courts and could have a bearing on how the company acts in other countries. The announcement is described as \"a success for consumer rights in the digital world,\" and it brings to a close one of Windows' darker periods. But some people are already asking whether feature updates to Windows 10 fall under the same banner, and wondering whether these will have to be treated in the same way.

    "content": " Chromebooks are gaining traction because they are simple, easy to use and offer great value. For consumers, they can be fantastic options. For enterprises, however, Chrome OS needs to go the extra mile in order to become more attractive. Google is well aware of the longer list of needs that enterprises have, as compared to consumers, which is why it has introduced a new plan, called Chrome Enterprise, that adds a whole host of new features designed specifically with business customers in mind. Chrome Enterprise builds upon Chrome OS by adding the following extras into the mix: The Microsoft Active Directory support \"allows employees to use their native credentials to authenticate across devices and Google Cloud Services like Google Play while centralizing management of user and device policies for IT admins,\" says Google. Chrome Enterprise also supports VMware Workspace ONE, the search giant adds. This \"will enable organizations to deliver device policies using customizable assignment of groups based on geography, device platform, department, role, and more -- simplifying policy enforcement across the company.\" As you might expect, Chrome Enterprise is not a free service. Companies wanting to take advantage of the extra features will have to pay $50 per device per year, which can be a substantial added cost depending on price of their Chromebooks. Google says that it will reveal more information about Chrome Enterprise in an upcoming webinar later today. It starts at 7pm EST. You need to register to join. © 1998-2025 BetaNews, Inc.

    "content": "Video Ad Feedback ESPN pulls announcer Robert Lee 01:25 - Source: CNN ESPN pulls announcer Robert Lee 01:25 Editor’s Note: Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of “Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.” She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia’s 900AM-WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Story highlights Roxanne Jones: We want to pretend sports are a sanctuary from world's ugly problems, but that has always been a farce ESPN and Robert Lee's mutual decision to switch games is not unreasonable in today's America, Jones writes CNN — In the testosterone-laced world of sports, sometimes your name means everything. Think not? I’ve seen men beaten by mobs just for having the gall to scream out “let’s go Cowboys” at an Eagles game. Think of all the racial epithets we’ve heard, of how one football player, Colin Kaepernick, silently taking a knee during the national anthem in personal protest of injustice in America has divided the nation. Roxanne Jones CNN We want to pretend that sports are a safe sanctuary from the world’s ugly problems, but that has always been a farce. Truth is, not even the glorious game of football can keep America’s toxic culture of bigotry, hate and violence at bay. It’s just too heavy a burden. So imagine if you’re scheduled to be the announcer for ESPN’s livestream of the University of Virginia’s season-opener football game against William and Mary in a few weeks and your name is Robert Lee. But you have watched , along with the world, as thousands of torch-wielding, white supremacists screaming hate-filled chants marched around the UVA campus and rallied all their hate at the foot of a statue bearing your name: Robert Lee. A monument the city had voted to remove under state objections. Well, it’s not unreasonable, even though you are Asian-American, that you — and your employer — may have some concerns. “This wasn’t about offending anyone. It was about the reasonable possibility that because of his name he would be subjected to memes and jokes and who knows what else. Think about it. Robert Lee comes to town to do a game in Charlottesville,” ESPN said in a statement that was tweeted late Tuesday night. “No politically correct efforts. No race issues. Just trying to be supportive of a young guy who felt it best to avoid the potential zoo.” It was a mutual decision, the network says, to switch Lee to the Youngstown State versus Pittsburgh game that same day. GLENDALE, AZ - NOVEMBER 13: Free safety Eric Reid #35 of the San Francisco 49ers and quarterback Colin Kaepernick #7 kneel during the national anthem before the start of the NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals at University of Phoenix Stadium on November 13, 2016 in Glendale, Arizona. (Photo by Chris Coduto/Getty Images) Chris Coduto/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Related article Kaepernick's protest is gaining support while he's still out of a job Nope, not unreasonable at all. Not in today’s America. Not when we just witnessed heavily armed, swastika-wearing protesters who believe in white supremacy clashing in the streets with counterprotesters, who believed just as passionately that all people are created equal. Not when one woman is dead and dozens more injured because they had the audacity to stand up to the failed notion of white supremacy. Not when a statue, or a team name, or a presidential tweet can incite racial tensions and violence. No matter that Robert Lee is Asian-American and his name has nothing to do with the Confederacy or slavery. It seems unreasonable, ignorant and downright ridiculous to associate his name in any way with the Confederate general. Still, nothing we’ve witnessed in Charlottesville, or since, has been reasonable or intelligent. Nothing we’ve seen in Charlottesville or other cities and towns where these types of protests and counterprotests have sprung up could be called reasonable. It’s disgusting. Killing one another, fighting, chanting Nazi slogans and counterslogans. Still, it continues. We continue. As racial tensions over police brutality, immigration and other issues have flared over the past several years in our nation, these statues have become lightning rods — symbolizing oppression, hate and the whitewashing of history for many of us, myself included. Others insist these monuments, of which there are dozens across the nation, are a symbol of Southern pride, an important part of American history. Right. If that were the case, wouldn’t we also have numerous statues of Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey or Harriet Tubman and countless others who fought for freedom and equality standing proudly outside government buildings, dotting college campuses? Just getting a national monument to Martin Luther King Jr. took decades . Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook Long before the Charlottesville riots, municipalities had begun to remove these Confederate monuments on public property, citing safety issues. And those efforts have increased since Charlottesville. From Baltimore to Brooklyn to Texas , these statues are toppling amid protest. While this national conversation continues, ESPN decided to avoid evoking the chaos during a live broadcast. Robert Lee decided he just wanted to do his job, which is to broadcast a livestream of a college football game. As one ESPN executive told me Wednesday: “Let’s not go to the zoo if we don’t have to go to the zoo.” Good call. Life is crazy enough already.",

    "content": "Mnuchin's wife mocks woman over wealth Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, caused jaws to drop this week with an Instagram post of herself stepping out of a U.S. government plane. She tagged a series of luxury designers such as Hermes, Tom Ford and Valentino in the post. Social media pounced on the post and called it ostentatious. The brouhaha illustrates a larger phenomenon on Instagram: Posts that look a lot like ads, even though they aren't labeled as such. In fact, Instagram is working hard to address the issue of transparency when celebrities and influential people endorse products -- or appear to -- on the platform. Sponsored posts without ad labels can be found to violate Federal Trade Commission guidelines. Instagram, owned by Facebook ( FB ) , announced in June it was introducing a \"paid partnership with\" feature. This would allow users to tag photos and Stories with a label that indicates it them as promotional. As of now, the feature is available only to a select group of business partners and creators. \"It's still early days. We do plan to make the tool widely available,\" an Instagram spokeswoman said. Related: Young Instagrammers user app 32 minutes Sponsored Instagram posts are increasingly common among well-known personalities. For example, the Kardashian sisters are known for leveraging their massive social media following to promote brands. In April, the FTC sent out more than 90 letters to Instagram influencers and marketers stating they need to \"clearly and conspicuously disclose their relationships to brands when promoting or endorsing products through social media.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published August 23, 2017: 4:13 PM ET",

    "content": "Politics FEC meeting must not be held every week – Presidency Published on August 23, 2017 By Chijioke Jannah The Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina has defended the President’s decision to cancel the Federal Executive Council (FEC) Meeting on Wednesday. According to him, no law stipulated that FEC must meet every week. He stated this when he featured on Channels Television’s Politics Today hosted by Seun Okinbaolye on Wednesday night. The presidential spokesman said concerns about its implications were uncalled for. He said: “There is no law that says the Federal Executive Council meeting should hold every week. There is no law that says it must be weekly. Under a past administration, it used to hold once every two weeks. “So, there is no law that says it should hold every Wednesday. It depends on what you have on the agenda to discuss. The President is the Chairman of that meeting. So, he has the discretion to hold or not to hold (the meeting).” President Buhari’s decision to cancel the meeting had led to more questions about his fitness to resume work and carry out his duties effectively. But Adesina dismissed the concerns, saying that the President was strong enough to perform his duties and that the office in his home and the one in his office complex were only a short distance apart. “The fact that FEC does not hold in one week does not mean anything significant because the President has the discretion to hold or not to hold FEC (meetings),” he said. Asked if the cancellation of Wednesday’s meeting meant that FEC would no longer be meeting weekly, he said it wasn’t the case, before going on to say that the meeting had not held every week over time in the first case. “That is not correct. It did not hold every week; when this administration began, it did not hold every week. And right from then, it had been understood that the FEC would hold as often as there are things to discuss,” Adesina said. Had today’s FEC meeting held and the President attended, it would have been the first he would be presiding over in more than three months.

In a statement issued in Lagos, Udeogaranya said such an action could send a positive signal to the Igbos that the Buhari administration was all inclusive He said: “As our president receives the report of the investigative committee headed by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo on allegations against the suspended Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Babachir Lawal, I candidly advise president Buhari to urgently search out a noble and patriotic Nigerian from the South-East zone of the country as a replacement. “This has become necessary due to the unintended omission of the South-East in the six principal offices of the Federal Government and on the effort to carry all Nigerians along in the governance of the country. “This singular action, if implemented by Mr president, would send a positive signal towards equity, justice, unity and aid national peace than rhetorics. “On a personal note, it will assist my campaign and that of all APC candidates from the South-East on various positions for the 2019 general elections. “I plead with my friend for many years and now the president of the country, President Muhammadu Buhari to pay more attention to the matters of concern in the South-East zone of the country. “Time has come for all Nigerians to help the country solve her many woes and create a beloved nation out of Nigeria.” Related Topics: buhari Charles Udeogaranya igbos SGF Up Next FEC meeting must not be held every week – Presidency Don't Miss Marginalization of Ndigbo: Ezeemo hails Nnamdi Kanu’s dogged fight You may like Naira redesign hardship: Court strikes out N1bn suit against Buhari, Emefiele Senator Adeola denies saying Buhari’s govt borrowed $400bn to stabilize local currency 2027: Don’t cause problem, let Tinubu do eight years like Buhari – Tompolo to Northerners 2027: Consider this call – Ex-Buhari campaigner urges Jonathan to contest 2027: Buhari finished eight years, presidency cannot return to North – Nwosu Atiku breaks silence on PDP defections, Buhari visit",

    "content": "Xbox One X Pre-Order Guide: GameStop, Best Buy Midnight Openings; Some Still In Stock Here's your chance to ensure you get a system on launch day. By Chris Pereira on November 6, 2017 at 10:32AM PST 1315 Comments November 6 update: Xbox One X is now just hours away from release. Certain stores--including GameStop and Best Buy --will have midnight openings in the US, allowing you to get your hands on one as soon as possible. While the Scorpio Edition is long gone in most cases, it is possible to still pre-order a standard unit from some retailers. Amazon and GameStop still availability online, as does the Microsoft Store --although, in that case, it says it will ship by November 30. Some stores could have units for walk-ins, but you may want to call ahead to make sure. If you're wondering if the system is worth all the fuss, check out our Xbox One X review and list of all the Xbox One X enhanced games . September 22 update: Amazon also now shows itself to be sold out, joining Target. A number of other US retailers are still offering pre-orders, but there's no telling how long they will last. Similarly, we don't know how easy it will be to find one in stores on release day, November 7. You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

Other retailers still show stock being available, however. Meanwhile, Walmart has brought its pre-orders online, giving you another potential place to pick one up. Stores may also have a limited selection of Xbox One X systems on its release date, November 7. September 20 update 2: Xbox One X pre-orders have gone live at multiple retailers in the US. For as long as they remain in stock, you can pre-order through Amazon , Best Buy , GameStop , Target , Microsoft Store , and Newegg . The previously announced GameStop bundles range in price from $570 to $800, although the system is also available on its own, too. Keep in mind these are the standard editions, not the Scorpio edition. They offer the same functionality; you'll simply be missing out on a special design and a free vertical base that allows you to stand your console upright. September 20 update: GameStop's Xbox One X pre-orders go live today, and Microsoft has announced that a number of other retailers will also follow suit. These include the Microsoft Store and Amazon. We'll report back with more specifics as they're available. September 19 update: GameStop has announced that it will offer pre-orders on the standard edition Xbox One X beginning on September 20 at 10 AM PT/1 PM ET. Quantities are likely to be limited. The retailer will also offer optional layaway bundles, as well as up to $200 in credit for PowerUp Rewards members who trade in their existing console toward the new system. August 25 update: If you've had trouble pre-ordering an Xbox One X, this might be why: Microsoft has announced it is the fastest pre-ordered Xbox console ever . The Scorpio Edition appears to be mostly sold out--although, again, you might have luck by continuing to check in at retailers that are currently out of stock. Microsoft says details on pre-orders of the standard edition will be shared at some point in September. We'll report back as we receive more information. August 23 update: Retailers have sporadically been bringing pre-orders back online over the last day. As of this writing, Target has them back in stock again, although they may not last long. As with the SNES Classics, which have reappeared briefly , it may be worth periodically checking the retailer listings linked below to see if you can get lucky. Keep in mind, the Scorpio Edition will be available by pre-order only, though the system is functionally identical to the standard Xbox One X model. Original Story: Microsoft's Gamescom livestream today brought with it the expected news: Xbox One X pre-orders are now live . Below, you'll find the basic details on how and where to pre-order the system. We'll continue to update this as more retailers bring their pre-orders online. The Xbox One X launches worldwide on November 7 for $500 / £449 / AU $649. Pre-orders are already available through a number of retailers, which you can visit through the links below. Amazon US [ sold out ] / Amazon UK [ sold out ] Best Buy / non-Scorpio Edition [not live yet] GameStop [ sold out ] / GameStop's Elite controller bundle / extra controller bundle [ sold out ] Game (UK) [ sold out ] JB Hi-Fi (AU) EB Games (AU) Microsoft Store / non-Scorpio Edition [not live yet] Target Walmart Gallery There are at least two bundles available-- GameStop is packaging the Elite controller with the Xbox One X for $600 in the US, a $50 discount over buying them separately. It also has another bundle with a second controller and more for $583. Microsoft has also announced a Project Scorpio Edition of Xbox One X for the same price as the standard edition. This is available by pre-order only and features a unique design and an exclusive vertical stand. According to a tweet from Microsoft's Albert Penello, any Xbox One X pre-order listing you see is for the Scorpio Edition, whether or not the listing reflects that. There's no word yet on when or if you'll be able to pre-order the non-Scorpio Edition. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "description": "FACT CHECK: 10 Statements From Trump's Phoenix Speech",
    "content": "FACT CHECK: 10 Statements From Trump's Phoenix Speech By Danielle Kurtzleben Published August 23, 2017 at 2:31 PM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Nicholas Kamm / AFP/Getty Images President Trump arrives at his campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. At a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, President Trump made news by slamming Republican senators, praising controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and blasting the news media. He also defended his initial, controversial remarks on recent violent protests in Charlottesville, Va. But in doing so, he left out the parts of the remarks that inflamed people's tempers the most, like his comment that there was violence \"on many sides.\" That's just one of the misleading or untruthful things Trump said. We fact-checked 10 of his statements. 1. Anti-Trump protesters \"And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK? That I can tell you.\" It's impossible to fact-check exactly what Trump knew about protesters — if Secret Service agents spoke to Trump about protesters or what agents told him, for example. But we do have at least some context on this claim: Trump very likely did see some protesters on his way to the convention center where his rally was held. In a pool report, Washington Times reporter David Boyer wrote about the anti-Trump activists along the route as the presidential motorcade drove to the rally site: \"We saw a smattering of supporters holding Trump/Pence signs and waving in the neighborhood near the hotel. As we got closer to the convention center, we saw more and more protesters. Hard to judge how many, but there were several hundred that we passed. \"Several people made obscene gestures at the motorcade. Some signs included 'Fire Trump' and 'Sad!' Also, 'Love One Another.' \" However, it's also possible that Trump didn't get the full scope of how many protesters were there, according to NPR's Geoff Bennett, who was traveling with the president as well. The motorcade didn't drive by the area where the overwhelming majority of protesters were gathered, Bennett reports. Those protesters numbered in the \"thousands,\" as Fox News and the Los Angeles Times reported. 2. Charlottesville statement \"I am really doing this to show you how dishonest these people are. Here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville. ... Here is what I said on Saturday: \" 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Va.' This is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event.\" The key part here is this sentence: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.\" Trump did say that, but he left out the second part of that sentence. The full sentence was: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides — on many sides\" (per a transcript from Vox). It was that \"many sides\" part that angered many people — it appeared to put the KKK, neo-Nazi and other white supremacist rallygoers on the same moral footing as the counterprotesters who opposed them. He made the comparison more than once in his responses to the events in Charlottesville. The Tuesday after the protest, he said : \"OK, what about the alt-left that came charging — excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\" he said in response to a reporter's question. He later added, \"You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\" 3. CNN ratings \"CNN, which is so sad, so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.\" Early in August, CNN released new data showing that its ratings are healthy . According to the report: \"Year to date, 2017 is pacing to be CNN's highest on record in Total Day among total viewers and highest among 25-54 since 2003. 2017 is also pacing to be CNN's second largest audience since 2008 in primetime among 25-54 and total viewers.\" In addition, Variety reported in June that CNN had its \"most-watched first quarter in 14 years.\" Of course, CNN isn't alone in getting these ratings boosts; all three major cable news networks \"saw double-digit ratings growth across the board for the second quarter of 2017,\" Variety also reported. Trump has made the claim before as part of his ongoing attacks on the media. He said CNN's ratings were down in July, too; PolitiFact likewise at the time found this to be \"flat wrong.\" 4. \"Racism was evil\" \"I said racism was evil. Did they report that I said racism was evil? No.\" Multiple headlines from an array of news outlets reported that Trump called racism \"evil\" in his Aug. 14 address — in which he also called out the KKK and neo-Nazis specifically after political pressure to do so. 5. New York Times \"apology\" \" The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, 'Well it wasn't really that much of an apology because they were losing so many people because they were misled.' \" Trump has claimed multiple times that the Times \"apologized,\" though this time he seemed to back off slightly by saying it \"essentially\" apologized. Either way, the New York Times did not apologize, as NPR's Jessica Taylor wrote in a fact-check of a Jan. 29 Trump tweet. \" New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet did write a letter to readers after the surprising election conclusion examining the paper's coverage. In the note, they acknowledged that 'after such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?' And a column from the paper's public editor (or ombudsman), Liz Spayd, pointed out problems with its data/forecasting vertical that predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning the election. She also argued that the paper's reporters could have done a better job of tapping into 'the sentiments of Trump supporters.' \"However, neither of those pieces constitutes an apology.\" The Times itself in a March 29 tweet responded to Trump: \"False, we did not apologize. We stand by our coverage & thank our millions of subscribers for supporting our journalism.\" 6. Health insurance premiums \"Arizona is a disaster in terms of your price increase ... 116 percent.\" This figure is correct. It comes from an October 2016 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. It found that among all states, Arizona would have the largest average premium hike in 2017, as measured by silver plans offered to 27-year-olds. But when talking about Affordable Care Act premium increases, it's misleading to not also mention tax credits. \"The caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the Affordable Care Act,\" as Will Stone, from NPR station KJZZ in Tempe, told NPR in March. Stone added that GOP efforts to overhaul health care would very likely have made the situation in Arizona worse. \"The Republican replacement ... would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like Arizona.\" 7. Job numbers \"Since I took the oath of office, we have added far more than 1 million jobs in the private sector. Unemployment is right now at almost a 17-year low.\" From February through July, U.S. firms have added 1,074,000 jobs , according to numbers from the Labor Department (with the caveat that those numbers are still subject to revision). That's solid growth, but it's not out of the norm for the last few years. And unemployment is 4.3 percent. The last time it was that low was May 2001, and the last time it was lower than that was February 2001 — so it has been 16 1/2 years since unemployment was lower than it is now. 8. Economic growth \"Economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent. Remember, everybody said you will not bring it up to 1 percent.\" Economic growth in the second quarter was indeed 2.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter. One can quibble with the word \"surged\" here, but 2.6 percent isn't at all an unusually high economic growth number. Economic growth is often around or above that level. But as far as \"everybody\" saying that Trump wouldn't be able to boost economic growth above 1 percent, that's false. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee in its December meeting, for example, projected 2.1 percent economic growth for 2017. Economic advisory firm IHS likewise projected that in 2017, growth would be above 2 percent — 2.3 percent, to be exact. Trump himself has said he's aiming for even higher growth: 3 percent, to be exact (and that's down from a 4 percent prediction he had made before). Even sustained 3 percent growth is unlikely to happen, according to many economists . 9. Increasing wages \"Wages are rising.\" Wages are indeed rising, but not very quickly — in fact, considering the low unemployment rate, economists continue to wonder why they aren't rising faster. \"The mystery continues to be with the labour market this tight, and the level of improvement we continue to see, that wages stubbornly stay at 2% year-over-year wage growth. To me that continues to be the mystery of the jobs report,\" as Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told the BBC after the July jobs report was released. In the last jobs report, wage growth accelerated slightly, to 2.5 percent annually, as Bloomberg reported . That's a positive development, but wage growth can bounce around from month to month; if the upward movement becomes sustained, that will be a more promising sign. As CNN reported after the last jobs report, many economists would consider wage growth around 3 to 3.5 percent to be a better sign that the job market is healthy. 10. Stock market highs \"The stock market is at its all-time high in history.\" Trump is right: The Dow Jones industrial average — one of the most closely watched stock indexes — has posted several record highs this year, passing the 22,000 mark in early August. The S&P 500, another popular index, has likewise hit multiple highs this year. All stock index records come with the caveat that they are not adjusted for inflation . In addition, Trump can't really claim credit for that entire rally, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in July. While his policy agenda of deregulation and lower corporate taxes may have some in the business community feeling confident, low interest rates and faster global growth are also likely helping to push stocks higher.

    "content": "New Yorkers Mourn End Of An Era As 'Village Voice' Ceases Print Edition By Camila Domonoske Published August 23, 2017 at 2:49 PM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Drew Angerer / Getty Images A Village Voice newspaper stand lays on the ground next to garbage in New York City's East Village on Tuesday. The Village Voice , one of the oldest and best-known alternative weeklies in the U.S., announced that it will no longer publish a print edition. You can swipe. You can scroll. But New Yorkers will no longer be able to flip through The Village Voice . This week, the legendary alternative weekly announced that it's ending its free paper version. In a press release distributed Tuesday, the publication said it plans to maintain its digital platform and continue to host events but will no longer be printing paper copies. The Voice had been in print for more than six decades and recently had a distribution of some 120,000 copies each week. It's the latest twist of the knife for a publication that has already seen round after round of layoffs , including of some of its best-known and most-beloved reporters and critics. The Village Voice was exposing Donald Trump when no one else was paying attention. pic.twitter.com/UvmzMpGheS — John Nichols (@NicholsUprising) August 22, 2017 And the news has been met with mourning and nostalgia in some corners of the New York media world (and beyond). Again. \"It's an NYC media tradition nearly as rich as the personal essay on leaving New York : Announce the Voice has betrayed you; memorialize her finer days; and declare her, as did the deserter before you, dead in grit and relevance,\" Simone Wilson wrote on Patch.com . Everyone agrees that in its heyday, the Voice was vibrant, energetic, essential, contrarian, contradictory, cantankerous and quintessentially New York. But nobody can agree on when, exactly, those glory days ended. \"For Voice devotees, the golden age was always the one just past,\" The New York Times writes . The Internet revolutionized classified advertising, sending shock waves through newspapers all across the country, including free alt weeklies. \"The business has moved online — and so has the Voice 's audience, which expects us to do what we do not just once a week, but every day, across a range of media, from words and pictures to podcasts, video and even other forms of print publishing,\" Voice owner Peter Barbey said in Tuesday's statement. Barbey purchased the alt weekly in 2015, amid scandal, as NPR's David Folkenflik reported at the time. \"Weekly papers are financially troubled these days, undermined by drops in readership, advertising and relevance,\" David said. \"For Village Voice and its sister papers one financial bright spot has been Backpage.com, an online classified ads site — but it has been denounced by religious activists, a U.S. senator and New York Times columnist Nick Kristof for enabling child prostitution. Backpage says it has spent much time and millions of dollars to ensure that its classifieds involve only legal activities and consenting adults, but the headaches endured.\" The legal struggles over Backpage continue ; prosecutors accuse the site of actively participating in prostitution, while Backpage says the ongoing pressure on its business amounts to \"unconstitutional government censorship.\" But now the ownership of the Village Voice and Backpage have been separated, and the alt weekly no longer \"solicits or accepts\" sex ads, according to the paper's statement. After investing in the print publication, upping the number of copies and improving the paper quality, Barbey is now shutting it off altogether. You can see an archive of old Voice editions over at Google . And you can also buy hundreds of old copies on eBay ... or, of course, on Craigslist . Copyright 2020 NPR.

    "content": "PUBG Invitational kicks off with first look at new map Damien Mason August 23, 2017 Software & Gaming Last month, PlayerUnknown himself let fans know that the upcoming PUBG map is still “many months” away . Good things come to those who wait, however, as Brendan Greene has since teased the new desert map during his keynote at Gamescom. Greene kicked off the first eSports LAN for the game in the best way possible, revealing that chicken dinners will soon get covered in sand when the new desert map makes its way to the game. Previously, we’ve been treated to two glimpses of what the map holds, but these were taken from in the thick of it and didn’t reveal a great deal apart from a cacti-ridden landscape. This new image gives us our first look at the sprawling cityscape littered with vantage points for snipers as well as the new colour palette that players will possibly adhere to when choosing what to wear into battle. ICYMI I revealed an early WIP look at the city on our new @PUBATTLEGROUNDS desert map at my @gamescom keynote! pic.twitter.com/9TE3nxj8T1 — PLAYER @ GAMESCOM (@PLAYERUNKNOWN) August 23, 2017 Despite the amount of buildings in the image, it is currently uncertain as to how many will be accessible for players to use, but I can only imagine the potential this city has for looting if you can get your foot in the door quick enough. Given the sheer size of the current Erangel map, this is only a portion of what to expect, prompting thoughts of how the distant mountains might come into play. Since they look rather difficult to traverse, this map might offer an entirely different dynamic than Erangel's hilly surroundings by playing off of a flatter environment. If this is the case, I can see many people likely to complain about render distance. Even more than they already do, I mean. Part of me still hopes that those mountains are climbable though because I'm just as likely to be the cause of my own death as snipers are. There is currently no set release date for the map and with developer Bluehole’s recent decision to drop the monthly update system to maintain quality, we might have a wait on our hands. Gamescom is currently hosting PUBG’s first Invitational ESL competition , pitting big eSports names like TSM, Cloud9, Team Liquid and Luminosity Gaming against one another. KitGuru Says: It’s good to see PUBG pushing a bit more on its variety, as I’m sure this will increase the games longevity. What do you think of the new map? Is there any type of setting you would like to see come to the game? Become a Patron! Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon Whatsapp Reddit",

    "content": "Headlines China wants Zambians and Zimbabweans to copy Chinese work ethic August 23, 2017 By editor 35 4,332 views Mrs Joyce Nonde speaking at the the First China-Zimbabwe-Zambia Work Ethics Seminar in Lusaka Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Mrs Joyce Nonde speaking at the the First China-Zimbabwe-Zambia Work Ethics Seminar in Lusaka The Chinese Government is working with the Zambian Ministry of Labour and the Zimbabwean Government to introduce strategies that will result in a change of work altitude among Zambians. Labour and Social Security Minister Joyce Simukoko said Zambian employees need to improve their work ethics in terms of good faith, senses of responsibility, discipline, team work and other necessary requirements. Mrs. Simukoko said good work ethics is an important support for enterprises to achieve their own development. She pointed out that not observing time and negative attitude towards work are common among Zambians. Mrs. Simukoko said the poor work ethic will hamper the implementation of the seventh National Development Plan and the realization of the 2030 vision of Zambia. The Labour Minister has since called on Zambians to actively study the Chinese people’s efficiency and emulate attitude towards work. And Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Yang Yanyi said that work ethics is the basic standard that people should follow in their professional life. Ambassador Yang said good work ethics must first adhere to the people-oriented concept to promote everyone’s overall development and value achieving. “The second aspect of work ethics is the sense of responsibility to ensure good professional performance. The third is the sense of honesty and creditability. Without honesty and creditability, an individual cannot succeed, and a country cannot thrive. Honesty and creditability is the premise for anyone to stand tall in society, is the basis for a stable society and is the source of a country’s prosperity. And the last is the sense of service. A humble heart, willing to devote or even to sacrifice, will help make the whole society run more smoothly,” he said. The First China-Zimbabwe-Zambia Work Ethics Seminar underway Ambassador Yang stressed that against the background of implementing the outcomes of the FOCAC and the promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative, the China-Zambia and China-Zimbabwe friendly cooperation has been elevated to a new height. “More and more Chinese enterprises have come to Zambia and Zimbabwe with their investment and Chinese, Zambians and Zimbabweans have easily become good friends through work. Due to cultural differences, the peoples of the three countries have different understanding towards work ethics, which cause misperceptions or even disputes in work and pose challenges to the bilateral pragmatic cooperation,” he said. He expressed hope that the peoples of the three countries should strengthen exchanges, seek common ground while reserve differences, learn from each other, to work together to promote each country’s socio-economic development, and to achieve win-win situation. The First China-Zimbabwe-Zambia Work Ethics Seminar was jointly held by the Chinese Embassy in Zambia, the Zimbabwean Embassy in Zambia and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security of Zambia recently in Lusaka. Meanwhile, Mrs. Takawira, Zimbabwean Ambassador to Zambia Getrude Takawira said with the continuous deepening of China-Africa cooperation, it is the right time to strengthen the education of good work ethics in African countries. She called on all African countries to learn from the successful practices of Chinese work ethics to better promote national development. editor http://www.lusakatimes.com 35 COMMENTS Sharon August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:08 pm Nothing wrong!  I have worked with the Chinese before, I was impressed!  The guys are hard-working and I hope we can learn from them! Mushota August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:16 pm Delusional Let me rn through a quote by the US President not long ago and i quote “”Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else … Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks.” This is what the US president thinks of you and I am sorry but US is the biggest and greatest country in the world I have given you the answer, you do the question. Thanks BB2014,2016 Meimatungu August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:23 pm Let it be “Chinese work ethic” and Chinese sharing ethic – you work and eat together; not one working and another eating! Lindiwe August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    5:14 pm Thats the beginnings of colonialism.Soon we will be asked to change our names to make it easier for our chinese bosses to call us. Environmental and cultural issues affect our perceptions of work. general Kanene August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    9:58 pm Now I want to see those big mouths who were last week talking about “Imperialism and Neo-Colonialism”, now you will be learning Chinese ethics, you can’t control and management yourselves, too much docility. Someone has to do it for you, and when they do, you call you find excuses. DAMN!!! FuManchu August 24, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:34 am @ Sharon its true the Chinese are hard working and those at work love what they do irrespective of TOR. My experience working with the Chinese at a construction site is there is no total work stoppage for a so called “lunch break” as while one would be taking their meal the others would continue with work. Nothing like on being taken on before the day wears out one is approaching the foreman for a “Ka advance!” and everyone tries to beat the other on reporting early for work! No wonder even the developed western countries are dead scared of the industriousness of the Chinese! Enka August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:14 pm Work ethic my foot .You’ll still have tribalism and corruption as impediments unlike the Chinese. IndigoTyrol August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:18 pm It works in China as they have dictators there. Those that disobey are never seen again. So I guess given the current climate in zed, this method suits ECL. Having said that, work ethics and etiquette need massive improvement. The government can try to look at methods used in the west (like U.K., Germany, USA…), and see how we can learn from them. But China sure? It says a lot about where our compass is pointing. manembo August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:31 pm @IndigoTyrol…Zambia has been following western methods and they have not worked. Why keep on trying something that has not worked. Eye-of-Horus August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    5:17 pm We just need to become better at being ourselves really. bwafyaa August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:18 pm YES, THIS IMPORTANT! All the aspects mentioned here:work ethics in terms of good faith, senses of responsibility, discipline, team work, honest, humbleness and spirit of service are important. WE KNOW WE NEED THEM BUT IF THEY HAVE TO BE PART OUR LIVES and our DESCRIPTION AS A PEOPLE and as a NATION , they MUST START IN OUR HOMES!! WE SEEM NOT TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE, LEAVING THEM TO SCHOOLS and CHURCHES and hope that our country can transform to fit into a prosperous one. And then WHAT ABOUT HAVING LEADERS WHO EXEMPLARY in these areas RATHER THAN THOSE WHO DOSE IN MEETINGS ON TV SCREENS!! Clifford Bwalya August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:21 pm The day we embrace Chines work ethics, we will become a strong nation, which is most unlikely given the mindset that has developed overtime. Where lying, dishonesty and corruption has become a household name and taken as normal part of social life. While we all are against corruption and lying by the politicians and bureaucrats etc; we ourselves do not practice honesty and truthfulness within our own family. kubweka August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    5:58 pm I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE CHINESE WORK STYLE.

In Zambia none of the qualities she has mentioning exist. Is she serious talking about honest and creditability as being ingredients for success in Zambia? She must be smoking a lot of weed. You can never be like the Chinese because the Zambian  leadership is corrupt. Tax money meant for schools, health and social welfare is being stolen daily.

That, in itself, sets the stage for Zambian attitudes to wards work. Now the government wants to know why? The government needs to set standards that meet citizen’s needs like set the maximum number of days to renew a passport at one month (like other countries like Kenya). And then fire someone if the target is not met. That will change the work ethic immediately webman August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    8:34 pm Being black hurts at all levels.

This is colonisation again. Our forefathers shudder in their grave yards upon learning how Africa is giving away what they rightfully fought for. They are busy buying and investing in land and have started to tune Africans to Chinese way of life through such forum. Wake up Africa. The guys have very poor or nonexistent safety ethics.

Eye-of-Horus August 25, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:35 pm I agree that there are areas that we need to work on as a people in terms of upping our game where productivity is concerned. But it’s not China’s place to lecture us on working hard, diplomatically that’s a big no, this is the talk of an imperialist. For all I know the average Zambian is frustrated because even tho we work hard, the wages are low, sometimes we don’t get paid or appreciated on the job, and that’s if the job is even available. Again we have a lot to work on as a people but we must not allow these sleepy eyed imperialists to lecture us as though we are children… they must just shut up and quietly do their business in Zambia and Zimbabwe, we can fix ourselves. And given fair conditions a Zambian is the best worker ever. Napela. Comments are closed.

Speaking during the Non-Governmental Organizations’ Coordinating Council (NGOCC)’s workshop with civic leaders and stakeholders on policies and laws on child marriage recently in Mansa District, Machina appealed to the civil leaders in Luapula Province to collaborate with the social welfare offices in the region to safeguard children’s lives. And Machina revealed that officers from social welfare are having challenges during their investigations because residents are economical with the truth, hence the need to work with ward councilors. Machina expressed optimism that if social welfare can collaborate with civic leaders, the rampant child negligence in the province will be curbed. “The Province has a high rate of child negligence in Zambia” Machina said editor http://www.lusakatimes.com 8 COMMENTS RudeMonk August 23, 2017\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    6:42 pm Its the whole Zambia bane.

    "content": "By ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: 21:27 BST, 23 August 2017 | Updated: 21:27 BST, 23 August 2017   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he and President Donald Trump are in regular contact about \"shared goals\" and working together to advance them. He says people suggesting otherwise are \"clearly not part of the conversation.\" McConnell says priorities include tax overhaul, spending and other bills. The Kentucky Republican released the statement Wednesday during a rocky period between the two leaders. Trump has criticized McConnell for the Senate's rejection of the GOP push to repeal President Barack Obama's health law. He suggested McConnell might need to step aside as leader if he can't push top bills through the chamber. People familiar with McConnell's thinking say he's privately expressed dismay over Trump's failure to clearly criticize Nazis after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and for the president's criticism of fellow Republicans.

Stringing the first letter of each of the seven paragraphs in the resignation letter together spells out the word — \"IMPEACH.\" Mr. President, I am resigning as Science Envoy.

Although Trump probably not smart enough to see your subtle message https://t.co/mC7mYpACrp — Lisa Wallace (@LCWallace1220) August 23, 2017 Kammen, a highly regarded energy specialist and head of UC Berkeley's Renewable And Appropriate Energy Lab, has served various roles for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, energy and state departments over the years. Currently, he is the Science Envoy to the Americas, a position he has held since 2010. In his letter, Kammen said Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville and his decision to abandon the Paris Climate Accord had triggered his resignation. \"Particularly troubling to me is how your response to Charlottesville is consistent with a broader pattern of behavior that enables sexism and racism, and disregards the welfare of all Americans, the global community and the planet,\" he wrote. \"Acts and words matter,\" Kammen continued. \"To continue my role under your administration would be inconsistent with the United States Oath of Allegiance to which I adhere.\" More from CBS News South Florida truck drivers divided over Trump's English requirement order First-time voter reflects on Trump's first 100 days Former HHS secretary Donna Shalala talks impacts of DOGE cuts South Floridians face long wait times for Social Security help amid staffing cuts Man accused of killing wife in Spain found dead in jail, attorney says In: Donald Trump © 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

    "content": "Local News Gov. Scott: Lawmakers Should Handle Proposals To Remove Confederate Monument From Capitol August 23, 2017 / 4:20 PM EDT / CBS Miami Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter TALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) – Gov. Rick Scott says it should be up to the Legislature to handle proposals to remove a Confederate soldier monument from the Capitol grounds. Democratic gubernatorial candidates and the Florida NAACP are among a chorus of people calling for Scott to relocate the memorial outside the Old Capitol or to hold a special legislative session on the future of Confederate monuments on public lands. The demands, at least in part, are a reaction to a white supremacist rally this month in Charlottesville, Va. that turned deadly. Scott held to his stance Tuesday that government agencies across the state that have Confederate markers on their property should make the final decisions about possible removal. And in the case of the monument outside the Old Capitol, Florida lawmakers will start holding a series of pre-session committee meetings Sept. 12. The controversial issue could be discussed early next year. \"We've got a regular session that starts in January, so that's just a few months away,\" Scott told reporters Tuesday after an Enterprise Florida board meeting in Fort Lauderdale. As of early Wednesday, no bills had been proposed to address the Confederate soldier memorial that has stood outside the Old Capitol since 1882. On Tuesday, the Florida NAACP demanded Scott and lawmakers remove the Confederate monument --- as well as flags and memorials representing \"hate, racism, and discrimination.\" \"We are and will continue to be steadfast and immovable in the fight against discrimination, prejudice and hatred,\" Adora Obi Nweze, president of the NAACP Florida State Conference, said in a prepared statement. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a Democratic candidate for governor, has directly targeted the Confederate soldier memorial as something glorifying history's \"ugliest moments.\" The monument lists Civil War battles participated in by Confederate soldiers from Leon County. Another Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Winter Park businessman Chris King, went further. \"These monuments should be removed because we should not celebrate literal anti-American ideology or any ideology based on the oppression of any group of people,\" King said in a statement. \"And to those who say these monuments are needed to preserve our history, I say we don't need memorials celebrating this dark time in our history.\" Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat expected to be challenged by Scott next year, tweeted Tuesday that \"Confederate statues belong in a historical museum or cemetery, not in a place of honor.\" The corrective tweet came a day after the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported that Nelson said, \"I think leaving it up to the good sense of the communities involved is the best thing to do.\" While the debate rages in Florida and other states, President Donald Trump has used Twitter to bolster support for such monuments, say it was \"sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\" The News Service of Florida's Jim Turner and Dara Kam contributed to this report.

    "description": "AccuWeather Caught Sending User Location Data, Even When Location Sharing Is Off",
    "content": "Wednesday, August 23 , 2017 Zack Whittaker : Security researcher Will Strafach intercepted the traffic from an iPhone running the latest version of AccuWeather and its servers and found that even when the app didn’t have permission to access the device’s precise location, the app would send the Wi-Fi router name and its unique MAC address to the servers of data monetization firm Reveal Mobile every few hours. That data can be correlated with public data to reveal an approximate location of a user’s device. […] “Everything is anonymized,” said Brian Handley, the company’s chief executive. “We’re not ever tracking an individual device,” but described a situation where his company can point advertising to customers inside a Starbucks location, for example. […] “Reveal is updating its SDK and pushing out new versions of the [software kit] in the next 24 hours, with the iOS update going live [Tuesday],” said an AccuWeather spokesperson. “The end result should be that zero data is transmitted back to Reveal Mobile when someone opts out of location sharing.” Via John Gruber : To me this is a one strike and you’re out situation. Update (2017-08-23): Ron Gilbert : iOS needs a setting to deny all internet access on an app-by-app basis, like they do access to the camera, contacts, etc. This is probably the iOS feature that I want most, although without more fine-grained control it seems incompatible with certain app types like weather. Jacob Terry : iOS should ask permission for network access similar to how it asks permission to access contacts and photos. Unlike those permissions, however, this one should be optional to the app author. […] To distinguish apps that opt-in, Apple should brand the feature (“Secure Networking”, for example) and have an accompanying logo. Apps that opt-in should get a badge in the App Store, and Apple should promote the feature, especially to enterprises. One more thing: authorization should happen per domain. Update (2017-08-24): John Gruber : AccuWeather issued a statement regarding the controversy over their app sending location-identifying information to a monetization firm . It’s a veritable mountain of horseshit […] […] The accusation is not that AccuWeather itself was using the location of the Wi-Fi router, but that Reveal Mobile was. […] In other words, Reveal Mobile makes money by revealing your location to retailers (anonymously, so they claim), and AccuWeather made money from Reveal by embedding their SDK in their app. Update (2017-08-28): Dark Sky : While the outrage may be warranted, the surprise shouldn’t be. This isn’t just a case of a single company monetizing their customer’s location data in a shady manner; it’s a much larger — and more widespread — phenomenon. How do I know? Because there are entire companies devoted to buying this very data from the countless apps that currently make use of location data, and they contact us all the freakin’ time. […] Because of this, we also believe that Apple and Google should do more to prevent this sort of behavior. They should set — and aggressively enforce — clear App Store rules forbidding the sharing of location data for any purposes not directly relevant to the app’s core functionality. If an app is caught breaking this rule, it should be removed from the store. This won’t stop all abuse, but it would, at the very least, put many of these data monetization companies out of the business of tracking where you go. Nick Heer : Here’s the thing, though: Grossman’s suggested response has been in place for years . […] All Apple had to do in this case was enforce their own rules. I understand that something will occasionally slip through the cracks and it will sometimes be with a high-profile app, but this is really the sort of thing that should have been caught. AccuWeather has removed Reveal Mobile but is now sending GPS coordinates to another company . AccuWeather Advertising GPS iOS iOS 10 iOS App Privacy Weather  I may be missing something on the technical side, but I read Gruber's righteous anger at this as a way of deflecting blame away from where it really belongs. Sure, what AccuWeather did is sorta sleazy, but did they actually break any AppStore policies? And more to the point, why were they even able to do this in the first place? In other words, why does Apple allow apps to access WiFi router names and MAC addresses? Is there any potential reason apps should ever have access to this info? And even if there is a potential reason, why isn't it regulated by the user per-app in the same way GPS is? The concept of geolocating by WiFi info isn't new, after all... (Also worth noting that none of this would have ever come to light if the app had sent and received the info in encrypted form, rather than plain text. Which means that there's no reason to think other apps aren't doing this, and won't be caught.) And tangentially: \"iOS needs a setting to deny all internet access on an app-by-app basis, like they do access to the camera, contacts, etc.\" \"This is probably the iOS feature that I want most, although without more fine-grained control it seems incompatible with certain app types like weather.\" It occurred to me a while back that the ability to use Little Snitch to let an app have internet access in a restricted manner only works in practice because LS is a fringe product. If Apple ever built fine-grained internet access user control into iOS, thus giving it a broad audience, the adversary would adjust. Instead of directly sending traffic to 3rd party sites, apps and websites would begin sending potentially objectionable traffic to their own site, and re-routing the traffic to the 3rd party sites from there. @Chucky Little Snitch’s protections are also a bit murky when many different services all use Amazon IP addresses. However, there are many apps that don’t need any network access at all, or perhaps only access via iCloud. I would be happy to be able to block my password app from the network entirely. \"Little Snitch’s protections are also a bit murky when many different services all use Amazon IP addresses. \" Oh, no doubt. But I'm still able to use it in a \"fine-grained\" manner to block various ad networks, analytics, trackers, and unnecessary Google services, etc. So, even though it is indeed murky, I can still block a fair amount of unwanted stuff. ----- But to move off the tangent back to the main topic here: Beyond the sensible suggestion of allowing per-app network blocks, am I crazy to think iOS has no business exposing WiFi info to apps? Because if so, it would totally eliminate this kind of backdoor location tracking. As you note, per-app network blocks wouldn't solve the problem that AccuWeather presented here. \"iOS needs a setting to deny all internet access on an app-by-app basis, like they do access to the camera, contacts, etc.\" \"This is probably the iOS feature that I want most, although without more fine-grained control it seems incompatible with certain app types like weather.\" iOS does support this. On all phones bought in mainland China in addition to the first run prompts for location and camera access, etc, there is a prompt for data usage. The user can select between WLAN, WLAN and Cellular, or none. These settings can later be reviewed in Settings>Mobile Data, in which there is an app by app listing of the data permissions. Selecting none has the side effect of killing banner adds on apps that run alone (without internet access) as they can’t access data to download an ad. Another particularity about the iPhones sold in mainland China is that they have a low-battery warning audible alert (20% and 10%) sound that can’t be turned off. It’s the same sound you hear through the headphones on other iPhones, ie. 3 descending tones in quick succession. This is on permanently and can’t be switched off (even on silent mode) in a similar fashion to the Japanese iPhones that have the camera sound hard-coded to be on. The only legitimate reason for accessing MAC address and router names that I can think of is for a network mapping type app, or perhaps for something that wants to encrypt something such that it can only be decrypted on a certain network (this I think is mostly a TV/movie fantasy; seems too easy to spoof or unreliable if the router dies, etc.). I'm guessing iOS 11 breaks this, as the release notes for the latest version of Network Analyzer Lite stated that it won't be able to display MAC addresses and device names for devices when running under iOS 11 due to iOS changes.  Which makes network mapping/scanning basically useless (if I don't already know a device's IP address) in order to protect us from abusive actors.  I wish Apple had locked it behind an entitlement instead, so that apps that really have a legitimate reason to gather/report this info could do so with Apple's permission, and bad actors would be stonewalled. @Chucky Yes, it seems like there should be an entitlement so that this info is only available to network scanning apps. Although apps could probably still build their own “local network fingerprint” to some extent.

    "content": "Wednesday, August 23 , 2017 David Barnard ( tweet ): Subscriptions work differently in TestFlight, the sandbox, and live on the App Store, so testing them requires knowledge of those differences. This is my attempt to help sort out the mess and document it for others to reference. […] It would be nice if the purchase flow while testing mirrored that of a live app on the App Store, but that’s just not the case for whatever reason. […] For an app that has yet to be released on the App Store, getting an early version of the app approved is a great way to test subscriptions[…] He suggests setting it to manual release and then sending out promo codes so that people can test the real app before it’s available to everyone. Implementing and testing subscriptions sounds like it’s much more complicated than you would expect. The developer of Ulysses says that it took their highly regarded team 1.5 man-years and 22K lines of code to implement subscriptions. Update (2018-04-20): See also: Supertop .

Expand By Denis Slattery and Jason Silverstein UPDATED: April 7, 2018 at 6:47 PM EDT President Trump’s threat of a government shutdown sent GOP congressional leaders into damage control mode and stocks tumbling on Wednesday. Trump’s fellow Republicans sought to ease fears after the President raised the specter of a shutdown over funding for his long-promised border wall. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he believes a barrier along the Mexican border is necessary, but cautiously added that closing the federal government was a bit of a stretch. “I don’t think anyone’s interested in having a shutdown,” he said during a visit to an Intel factory in Hillsboro, Ore. “I don’t think it’s in our interest to do so.” Trump also appeared ready to tone down his rhetoric — for now — following his fiery Phoenix rally . “It is time to heal the wounds that divide us and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us,” the President told a crowd of veterans in Reno, Nev. President Trump at his Phoenix rally. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finally addressed media reports that he and Trump have grown so angry with each other that they haven’t spoken in weeks. McConnell insisted he and Trump are unified on policy goals, such as funding the government and ending Obamacare, but he had few warm words about their relationship. “We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation,” McConnell said in a statement. The White House later issued a statement of its own, saying that the pair “remain united on many shared priorities, including middle class tax relief, strengthening the military, constructing a southern border wall, and other important issues.” Wall Street seemed rattled by Trump’s rhetoric on Wednesday, as stocks took a dive. The S&P 500 index fell .35% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell .4%. Congress has roughly 12 working days when it returns from recess after Labor Day to produce a spending bill or vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government operating. During his tirade, Trump labeled Democrats as “obstructionists” who are more interested in playing politics than working with him. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer scoffed at Trump’s threat. “If the President pursues this path, against the wishes of both Republicans and Democrats, as well as the majority of the American people, he will be heading towards a government shutdown which nobody will like and which won’t accomplish anything,” Schumer said Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) By Megan Cerullo UPDATED: April 7, 2018 at 6:49 PM EDT President Trump punctuated part of his speech at a rally in Arizona Tuesday with a bizarre exclamation of the word, “Antifa!” He singled out the group of activists after he accused “both sides” of contributing to the violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12. His refusal to condemn white supremacists for the clash that killed Heather Heyer, 32, drew heavy criticism. He continued his tirade against the “many sides” he believes were behind the violence Tuesday. “They show up in the helmets and the black masks and they have clubs — they’ve got everything. Antifa!” he said. He yelled “Antifa!” as if he were singing to the tune of The Champs’ hit song “Tequila.” Comedian Chris Stevens was quick to set the speech to the song on Twitter.

Andrew Savulich/New York Daily News A rally for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began outside of the NFL Headquarters in Manhattan on August 23, 2017, drawing hundreds of protesters. People touted signs demanding that the football league sign Kaepernick, who is currently a free agent, after their alleged blackballing of the athlete due to his voicing disapproval of race relations in the U.S., most notably in the form of refusing to stand for the national anthem during games.

Many also raised fists in support. Expand By Noah Goldberg | New York Daily News , Denis Slattery and Nancy Dillon UPDATED: April 7, 2018 at 6:47 PM EDT Supporters of Colin Kaepernick went on the offensive on behalf of the jobless quarterback on Wednesday. Hundreds of protesters crowded the sidewalks outside the National Football League’s Park Ave. headquarters in Midtown to voice their anger over what they say is the systematic banishment of the 29-year-old. Kaepernick finds himself without an NFL job after he began kneeling during the national anthem before games last season. Hundreds of protesters crowded the sidewalks outside the National Football League’s Park Ave. headquarters in Midtown to voice their anger over what they say is the systematic banishment of the 29-year-old. Protesters at the “United We Stand” rally, organized by the NAACP, sang, chanted and called on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to intervene. Kaepernick, who played six seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, remains unsigned after opting out of his contract with San Francisco. Protesters at the “United We Stand” rally, organized by the NAACP, sang, chanted and called on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to intervene. “What’s happening to him is wrong and needs to be rectified,” said Kaepernick fan Kyle Bennett, 47. “He’s been blackballed out of the league. Now that he’s out they decided they aren’t letting him back in. Basically the message is to other players, this could happen to you, too.” Speakers at the rally included Rep. Gregory Meeks, Councilman Jumaane Williams and activist Linda Sarsour. The NAACP wants a face-to-face with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (pictured) over Colin Kaepernick taking the knee. The demonstration was timed to coincide with a letter sent by NAACP interim President and CEO Derrick Johnson to Goodell requesting a meeting about Kaepernick. Johnson said in the letter that it was “no sheer coincidence” that Kaepernick remained unemployed after gaining widespread attention last year for quietly kneeling during “The Star Spangled Banner.” Kaepernick has said he started his silent pregame protest ritual to draw attention to racism and police brutality. Goodell’s office have said Kaepernick’s actions did not violate the league’s code of conduct. <img  loading=\"\" class=\"lazyload size-article_feature\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Kaepernick, 29, played for the San Francisco 49ers for six seasons — and gained widespread attention last year when he began kneeling for The Star Spangled Banner to protest racism and police violence.” title=”Kaepernick, 29, played for the San Francisco 49ers for six seasons — and gained widespread attention last year when he began kneeling for The Star Spangled Banner to protest racism and police violence.” data-src=”/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/23/SMIZCLC5PDEI6LO77EGBFZY6PI.jpg”> Kaepernick, 29, played for the San Francisco 49ers for six seasons — and gained widespread attention last year when he began kneeling for The Star Spangled Banner to protest racism and police violence. A spokesman for the NFL said they had not yet received Johnson’s letter and that organizers of the United We Stand Rally Coalition “declined the opportunity to participate in the meeting we were looking to set up.” The rally comes four days after a group of retired and active cops, including legendary NYPD whistleblower Frank Serpico, banded together in Brooklyn to say they have Kaepernick’s back. Outside of the NFL offices on Wednesday, demonstrators held signs in support of the veteran play-caller and shared their frustrations. “I think that Colin Kaepernick represents a larger moment in our country,” Sarsour told the Daily News. “People are using any platform they can to stand up against racial injustice. “We’re asking the NFL to sign him and to institute a policy that protects the freedom of speech and protest for all players,” she added.

Photo / Stephen Jaquiery Lorraine Harvey, whose house is built on the former Bain family property, wants the name of a feature film changed. Photo / Stephen Jaquiery By Timothy Brown and Shawn McAvinue Lorraine Harvey was far from thrilled when she heard the working title of a planned feature film about the Bain family murders. For Harvey, 65 Every St is not just the name of a project or a macabre fascination - it's her home. She read in Tuesday's Otago Daily Times that Abacus Multimedia producer Paul Dobson intended making the film and naming it after the address of her home. The Bain house was burned to the ground by the Fire Service soon after the 1994 murders. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. She and her late husband Stewart bought the section and built a house on it, which she had called home for the past 20 years. ''It's the full address [being used as the title] that's really getting up my nose,'' she said. ''He can make his film but does he really need to call it that? Stewart would be horrified if he knew. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. ''He can make the film, just not make it 65 Every Street . Surely he can come up with something more original than that.'' It never occurred to the couple to use another number when they built the home two decades ago, but not doing so was a ''big mistake''. ''[People] come on to the property,'' she said. ''It's an invasion of privacy. It's unbelievable that it can still go on after all this time and every time Bain is mentioned in the paper I get someone coming past.\" On occasions drunk sightseers had come on to the property as if it was some kind of ''museum''. ''They just thought they had the right to drive on the property,'' Harvey said. ''He can make his film, but please don't call it that.'' She feared the film's release and promotion would make the problem worse than it already was. ''It will - it definitely will,'' she said. Dobson, speaking from Sydney last night, said the proposed movie name 65 Every Street was ''set in stone'' and would remain so because no one had contacted him with concerns about it. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. He welcomed anyone with concerns to contact him. ''If they want the name changed, they have to begin the discussion. Until we hear from anybody we won't be doing anything. That's fair, isn't it?'' Abacus Multimedia also owned the website domain name 65everystreet.com, he said.

BART announced the closures in a release Tuesday , explaining that the real estate being used by the entrances and tunnel is needed for a new power substation that will increase BART's hourly capacity through the Transbay Tube at peak hours. From the release: Looking towards the near future, BART needs to install a new traction power substation at Civic Center as part of our Measure RR rebuilding efforts and strategies to increase capacity into and out of the city. New substations, along with upgrades to our train control system and a new fleet of rail cars will allow BART to increase peak capacity by 25% through the Transbay Tube. We currently run 24 trains per hour in each direction through the Transbay Tube, these planned improvements will enable us to increase to 30 trains per hour. Hoodline notes that at least one of their readers was alarmed by the news because it means that there will be two fewer exits from the busy station in case of fire. But the Grove Street entrance has actually been closed since December due to a collapsed sewage pipe beneath the escalators, and many who are familiar with these entrances know that that weird tunnel wasn't always the most pleasant walk anyway. Per the release, \"While the station will likely lose these two entrances, there are others still available that are located much closer to the platform, fare gates, and ticket vending machines and riders will gain the benefits of more frequent and more reliable service.\" Indeed, on the other side of Eighth Street, at Market (in front of the Orpheum Theater and Trinity Place on the opposite side) there are the two main entrances to the station, situated near the end of the Muni platform where outbound trains stop. And then there is the large escalator in UN Plaza, as well as two other entrances on either side of Market at Seventh Street. BART isn't saying for certain that the entrances will be going away, but that seems to be almost certainly the case. In the short term, look for the wooden structure over the Grove Street entrance to disappear and be replaced with a flat metal plate over the entrance.

    "content": "The UK proposals on the border likely to underwhelm, as the Ref 2 debate hots up Brian Walker on August 13, 2017, 11:06 am | Readers 2948 Theresa May has had  the temporary excuse of being on holiday to explain away the continuing churn over Brexit inside and outside the government. No more. She returns from holiday this week. Little to comfort her awaits.  Rather than a produce a rallying cry the promised publication of several major Brexit policy documents by midweek is likely  to give both sides of the debate more ammunition to throw at each other. By themselves they cannot constitute  a coherent strategy. But taken  together, will they  persuade the EU commission that enough is on offer from the British to allow the negotiations to move on to the crucial issues of trade, without  which no border solution and much else can be settled? This is surely the crucial point. On the border, the Sunday Telegraph has received the t raditional Sunday advance After Brexit EU nationals will be allowed to come on holiday in Ireland and not show passports to get into the UK. But they will not be allowed to work in the UK because they will not have a work permit. The source said: “Irish citizens will fundamentally have better rights than other EU nationals.” An estimated 20,000 people every year from the Irish Republic come to work on the British mainland. The Irish border will be policed by “very advanced” CCTV cameras at border points such as automated number recognition systems which are commonly used by police in Britain. The Government will also develop a trusted trader scheme which will allow goods to  be carried north and south from established firms. If  the debate in Dublin in advance of the British proposals  is any guide, the response of the Irish political class to this will be very cool indeed. They will respond with a resounding chorus of “ big deal” on free movement and “ it won’t work” to technological solutions to the border problem. But equally keenly awaited will be the response of the EU Commission. If the Commission receives the British proposals positively, the UK government will have taken its first effective initiative. The proposals on the border and the rest would be taken as work in progress and not the last word. Brussels’ and  Dublin’s responses would  be cautiously framed accordingly.   If not, where do we go from there? Meanwhile, the debate on a second referendum has been hotting up.  Following on from May’s election disaster the political case was made earlier this week by the leading constitutional thinker, Vernon Bogdanor. The election re-opens the issue of Europe – for four reasons. First, there is probably no Commons majority for May’s version of Brexit. Indeed, there is probably a stronger representation of remain MPs in parliament today than before the election. Second, Labour’s electoral gains raise the question of whether the decision in the 2016 referendum is final: for, although Labour was not a remain party this year, the British Election Study found that the party’s “soft Brexit” policy played a large part in its substantial gain in votes. In constituencies where over 55% voted remain, the party achieved a swing of around 7%. The election was the revenge of the remainers. Third, the election intensifies internal divisions in both major parties. If the eventual deal is too “hard”, Conservative remainers may join with their opposition counterparts to defeat it; if too “soft”, Tory Eurosceptics could ensure its rejection. There may be no majority for any of the forms of Brexit on offer, with the Commons deadlocked. Fourth, the House of Lords – in which the pro-remain Liberal Democrats and crossbenchers hold the balance of power, and the proportion of remainers is probably even higher than in the Commons – will feel emboldened to reject a hard Brexit, arguing that a minority government has no mandate for it. When he thought he was going to lose in 2016, Nigel Farage said that a further referendum would be needed : there is no doubt that Brexiteers would have continued their campaign to take Britain out of the EU and they would have had every democratic right to do so. But so equally do those who have doubts about the decision. Brexit after all raises fundamental, indeed existential, issues for the future of the country. That is why the final deal needs the consent not only of parliament, but of a sovereign people. Labour’s potential king over the water David Miliband entered the lists in the Observer. Leaving the EU was mis-sold as a quick fix. Now it looks like a decade-long process of unscrambling the eggs of national and European legislation. Ministers cannot even agree among themselves the destination, the route map or the vehicles to get us there. I never thought I would say this, but the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also playing a valiant role. The transition he supports is vital. However, a transition postpones a rupture rather than avoiding it. Slow Brexit does not mean soft Brexit . Steve Baker, minister in the department leading the negotiations, has been refreshingly honest in saying the transition period is a “soft landing for a hard Brexit”. We have been warned The case against the EU depends on avoiding a discussion of the alternative. IT is the equivalent of voting to repeal Obamacare without knowing the replacement. It is a stitch-up. That is one reason it is essential that parliament or the public are given the chance to have a straight vote between EU membership and the negotiated alternative. That is a democratic demand, not just a prudent one. People say we must respect the referendum. We should. But democracy did not end on 23 June 2016. The referendum will be no excuse if the country is driven off a cliff. MPs are there to exercise judgment. Delegating to Theresa May and David Davis, never mind Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, the settlement of a workable alternative to EU membership is a delusion, not just an abdication. Brexit is an unparalleled act of economic self-harm. But it was a big mistake to reduce the referendum to this question. The EU represents a vision of society and politics, not just economics. We need to fight on this ground too. But “ valiant” Philip Hammond is reported to have reached agreement with the arch-Leaver Liam Fox on what a transition would mean. The ministers – representing the Remain and Leave wings of the Tory party –  say this will be “time limited” and designed to avoid a “cliff edge” that could damage British business. Although they do not say how long this period will last, it will not represent an attempt to stay in the EU indefinitely, they say. Whether this alleged  compact  is more than cosmetic and temporary  remains to be seen. Hammond seems to be saying, “sure, of course we’ll quit the single market and the customs union” while bidding to replace it with third nation or bilateral arrangements which amount to pretty much the practical status quo. Fox’s language  envisages far greater freedom and opportunity to cut deals with the wider world. As Theresa May returns from holiday this week, we can expect she’ll try to put her own stamp of authority on the publication of the Brexit papers to quell unrest in the cabinet and party. And her chances of success, according to the Mail on Sunday? Theresa May will try to head off a threat to sack her as Prime Minister by making a public plea to Tory supporters to give her another chance. She will make a grovelling apology at the Conservative Party Conference for the loss of the Government’s majority at the General Election. News of Mrs May’s ‘mea culpa’ speech – live on TV in a Sunday confessional at the start of the rally in Manchester on October 1, and three days before her main speech – came as the Tories were rocked by more divisions. It emerged last night that: Former Minister and pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry warned she could quit the party if Mrs May pursued a ‘hard Brexit’ stance; Pro-Brexit MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has reportedly let slip his own secret plan to succeed Mrs May; ( he denied it, sort of, this morning) Chancellor Philip Hammond and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson are said to be poised to back a leadership bid by fellow ‘soft Brexit’ supporter Home Secretary Amber Rudd.

    "content": "“the UK does not want to see border posts for any purpose…” Mick Fealty on August 16, 2017, 4:51 pm | Readers 2386 Quickly, here’s a resume of Theresa May’s piece in the Irish News today : On the citizenship rights guaranteed by the Belfast Agreement, our position is clear. Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the United Kingdom, but it is also the permanent birthright of the people of Northern Ireland to hold both British and Irish citizenship. And… We also want the EU funding that has helped victims of the Troubles and cross-community groups to continue at least until the current programme finishes. We then want to go further, and explore a potential future programme of peace funding after we leave the EU. Then on free movement for British and Irish citizens: For those concerned about freedom of movement across Northern Ireland and Ireland, our proposal is clear: we want to maintain the reciprocal arrangements for the Common Travel Area and all the rights for our citizens that have existed in some form since 1922. It allows British and Irish people to move freely across our islands, and is at the core of the deep social, cultural and economic ties that link us together. It goes beyond just the ability to move between our islands without passport controls, and also means guaranteeing continuing rights for UK and Irish nationals to work and access public services. On the border: …there should be no physical border infrastructure of any kind on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. I want people to be absolutely clear: the UK does not want to see border posts for any purpose. Economics… …preserving North-South and East-West cooperation, and making sure the all-Ireland energy market is protected. All of this work only underlines the importance of getting the Northern Ireland Executive back up and running. That is an urgent goal for me and Secretary of State James Brokenshire. And it is one the Irish Government shares. Then it’s a rinse and repeat to the finish… Mick Fealty Mick is founding editor of Slugger.

    "content": "Despite McGuinness’ charisma SF ministers and MLAs have made a poor fist of government Mick Fealty on August 17, 2017, 1:07 pm | Readers 4224 Whilst the institutions are down (and they may be down for some time) rather than just assume we’re all getting back into the same car only for it to crash again another 12 months down the road it’s worth using for some honest assessments of what keeps going wrong. Fionnuala O’Connor nails one assumption that’s gone hugely under reported, ie that good as they are at winning elections, Sinn Fein’s actual record in government has been pretty abysmal. McGuinness made charisma and his personal transition go a long way, but close recorders of Stormont thought from the start, some unwillingly, that his ministers and MLAs for the most part made a poor fist of it. The DUP would still have stymied them even if republican ministers had been any good, some say bleakly, but good, almost without exception, they weren’t. Someone, patience exhausted, agrees DUP blocking was routine. ‘But the Shinners wasted their chances through lack of imagination, ignorance and plain incompetence. They never put the DUP to the test.’ Their handling of Casement through ministerial office and departmental committee alike alienated many, some of them formerly devoted. Sports grounds from earlier eras in built-up areas are a problem everywhere but this was the heartland, west Belfast, and a basic issue of safety was swamped by political game-playing. Sinn Féin sloppiness in Stormont and inattention to detail damaged the GAA; far from blameless themselves, but who seemingly had been told to leave it to the party. Then the party’s reaction to criticism was the usual conflict-era truculence, knee jerk ‘if you’re not with us you’re against us’, although the dominant west Belfast reflex has always been to soften criticism of Sinn Féin out of wishful-thinking loyalty. And for good measure: The tragic speed of the McGuinness decline and death lent cover, the crashed executive extended it, the assembly election result disguised the flaws in organisation and personnel, the shallowness of the talent pool. But the weakness is multi-layered. Which is another reason, on top of dour acceptance that the show lacks merit, for Sinn Féin’s lukewarmness about re-establishing a production in Stormont. That Northern Ireland’s democracy can be used as a party political chattel to cover for such weaknesses in government, compounds the issue. Yesterday Fionnuala’s stablemate, Brian Feeney speculated that a SF/FF coalition would be good for northern nationalists. Yet it’s hard to see how a political party – which collapsed under the heat of a highly limited Opposition after just seven months in Northern Ireland – is in any way shape or form ready for such senior hurling. Indeed, in the Republic, we can expect what is in effect a prolonged boycott of power sharing in Northern Ireland to feature in the run in to the next general election as a reason they’re both unready and unfit to play the game of government.

    "content": "Editing the Past Soapbox on August 22, 2017, 6:02 pm | Readers 1585 David Capener is a writer based in Belfast, an Editorial contributor at Archinet and a reporter for World Architecure Community. He blogs at www.futurecrowds.com All history is biography. It is the story we tell ourselves to make sense of the world; our place in it, and, those we share it with. Stories shape our world and the storyteller shapes the story. One of the ways our stories find expression is through the manifestation of symbols — flags, images, colours, statues. By pledging allegiance to a certain flag, adopting a particular colour or memorialising a hero in the form of a statue we embed ourselves in a story. We only truly understand the power of the stories we live in when they collide with other stories; sparks fly, and the world that gave us sense and meaning is challenged. From minor disagreements with friends in a pub, to a senseless act of violence perpetrated by a white supremacist in Charlottesville, driving his car at speed into a crowd of peaceful protesters; the power of stories runs deep — we are narrative creatures. By now we are familiar with the story —the removal of a potent symbol; a confederate statue in Charlottesville. A lone confederate statue in a town square is an edited version of history. Those who edit history do so to create a narrative which works in their favour. Removing this statue from the town square is no less an act of editing history than those who put it there in the first place. The statue told a lopsided version of the past — the defeated so-called ‘hero’ fighting for the continuation of slavery in the southern states. Perhaps a better solution would have been to tell the whole story. Imagine the symbolic power of a confederate statue, a black slave and a Union solider. To forgive is not to forget but to remember. To remember is an act of imagination; to imagine a future world that learns form its past mistakes and builds on its success. To remember is to be part way along the journey to understanding the stories of those we might oppose — even though, like the neo-Nazi sympathisers in Charlottesville, we might find those stories deeply abhorrent. As I walk with my children through the grounds of Belfast City hall, we look at the statues —I tell them a story. My storytelling requires that I provide information about the story of our nation that is not immediately apparent. Queen Victoria, opposer of the slave trade, but ignorer of the scores who died during the Irish famine. The ‘famine Queen’ takes her place in a redacted storyline. Eliza Ward, murdered saving the life of her boss in the city hall cafe, rightly has a plaque, and the Titanic memorial statue sculpted as the female personification as death, but Queen Victoria remains the only woman among men; all white; predominantly Unionist, or from a Protestant background. According to Belfast City Council’s website the grounds around the City hall “contain a wealth of memorials to the history, people and events associated with the City.” This is true, but only in part. The city has never been predominantly male, Protestant or Unionist and between the famine years of 1845-51 the population of Ulster fell by 340,000, with harrowing accounts of emaciated families queuing at soup kitchens — the governments inadequate response to the crisis. An Irish famine memorial alongside the statue of Queen Victoria would presumably be telling a better, more accurate version of the story of our City. Why not add a statue of one of the first women elected to the Northern Irish parliament, Julia McMordie, next to the statue of her husband MP RJ McMordie? What about non Unionists? Activists? Peacemakers? Or, perhaps an empty plinth like the one in Trafalgar Square which can host different statues reflecting the diversity, not just of our past, but of our present. We edit the past to the detriment of the generations who will follow us. The ability to tell the stories of our pasts (intentionally plural), however difficult, can help us navigate the complexities of the present. This is not an easy path to navigate, but a path that gives us no choice except to journey along it. How we decide to make that journey matters.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday ordered foreign staff members of a US nonprofit that receives support from the US government to leave the country within a week, part of an apparent attempt to silence opposition voices in the lead-up to national elections next year. Cambodia is ruled by one of the world's longest-serving leaders, Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party received a strong challenge from the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party in local elections in June. Cambodia's autocratic leader Hun Sen (right) has also alarmed critics with his attacks on a newspaper that's scrutinised his family's business interests. The US nonprofit, the National Democratic Institute, is loosely affiliated with the United States' Democratic Party and has provided training to various Cambodian political parties, including those from the opposition. Local media organisations with ties to the ruling party have accused the organisation of conspiring against Hun Sen. On the Cambodia page of its website, the National Democratic Institute includes a critical description of the grip Hun Sen's party has on the country. \"The governing Cambodian People's Party continues to dominate after 30 years under the same leader,\" the site says. \"Citizens are limited in their engagement of elected officials, and mistrust between civil society and government impedes a fully inclusive and participatory democracy.\" 'Total contempt' In a statement, Cambodia's Foreign Ministry blamed the non-profit for operating \"with total contempt\" while its application to comply with a law requiring registration of such groups was pending. The statement also referred to the nation's tax code without specifying what the organisation may have done to run afoul of tax regulations. The action against the organisation drew a sharp rebuke from critics of the government. \"There have been multilevel efforts by the government and government institutions to restrict and repress the opposition party, civil society and the media,\" said Naly Pilorge, deputy director of advocacy at Licadho, a Cambodian human-rights organisation. Advertisement \"Whether it's the courts or the tax department or new legislation, all these mechanisms are being used by the government to crack down on its critics,\" she said. Also facing a tight deadline is The Cambodia Daily , an independent newspaper that has served as a training ground for local reporters and budding foreign correspondents alike. The newspaper has been issued with a tax bill of more than $US6 million, which it contests. On Tuesday, while at an environmental event in the capital, Phnom Penh, Hun Sen implied that the newspaper, which was founded by a US journalist, was a \"thief\" and said it needed to \"pack up and leave\" if it failed to pay back taxes. The deadline to pay is September 4. The action has alarmed free-speech advocates, who say the paper has aggressively pursued worthwhile topics. \" The Cambodia Daily has tried to apply international standards of news writing in Cambodia, and it has aggressively covered sensitive issues, like corruption, land-grabbing and illegal logging,\" said Moeun Chhean Nariddh, director of the Cambodia Institute of Media Studies. \"But unfortunately Cambodian democracy is very young. Press freedom is still fragile.\" Radio stations questioned At least a dozen Cambodian journalists have been murdered since the early 1990s. Human-rights activists have been fatally shot in broad daylight. In recent days, other media organisations that have aired views critical of the government have been threatened. The Cambodian Ministry of Economy and Finance has also raised questions about the legal and tax status of Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, which both receive US government funding. Local radio stations supportive of the opposition have been silenced. \"Every day that we get to put out a newspaper is a good day for us,\" said Jodie DeJonge, the editor-in-chief of The Cambodia Daily , which has clashed for decades with government officials and tycoons over its investigative pieces. \"There is still a free press in Cambodia, and we are going to rely on that until they come and put yellow tape around the building.\" The New York Times Save Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Washington: Daniel Kammen, a renewable energy expert appointed last year as a science envoy to the State Department, resigned on Wednesday, citing President Donald Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, as the final straw that led to his departure. In a resignation letter posted to Twitter, Kammen wrote that Trump's remarks about the racial violence in Virginia had attacked \"core values of the United States\" and that it would have \"domestic and international ramifications.\" However, his most biting message may have come in the form of a hidden acrostic; the first letter of each paragraph spelled out \"I-M-P-E-A-C-H.\" Demonstrations by white supremacist groups on August 12 turned deadly after a neo-Nazi ploughed a car into a crowd, killing one counterprotester and injuring at least 19 other people in Charlottesville. Two police officers were also killed when their helicopter crashed. The Charlottesville riots. Credit: AP Trump's response was widely criticised, even by some by members of his own political party, for being insufficient and vague. Kammen, who was appointed during Barack Obama's presidency, said it would be unconscionable for him to continue serving the administration after those remarks. He said he stood with \"the unequivocal and authoritative statements\" of a slew of other public officials, both Democratic and Republican. \"Acts and words matter,\" Kammen wrote. \"To continue in my role under your administration would be inconsistent with the principles of the United States Oath of Allegiance to which I adhere.\" Advertisement In his resignation letter, Kammen also cited other concerns that predated Trump's Charlottesville comments, including the president's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in June. Marcus Martin, right, hugs his fiance Marissa Blair, left, during a memorial for Heather Heyer, the counterprotester who was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia. Credit: AP \"Particularly troubling to me is how your response to Charlottesville is consistent with a broader pattern of behaviour that enables sexism and racism, and disregards the welfare of all Americans, the global community and the planet,\" Kammen wrote. \"Your decision to abdicate the leadership opportunities and the job creation benefits of the Paris climate Accord, and to undermine energy and environmental research are not acceptable to me. . . . Your actions to date have, sadly, harmed the quality of life in the United States, our standing abroad, and the sustainability of the planet.\" Daniel Kammen,  an energy professor at the University of California, and former science envoy in US State Department. Credit: University of California, Berkeley The State Department appointed Kammen, an energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, as one of five U.S. science envoys in March 2016. At the time, Kammen said he would be working on various global energy initiatives, as well as \"the wider Paris Accord.\" During his approximately 18 months as a science envoy, Kammen said, the United States had \"built significant partnerships in North and East Africa, and in the Middle East, around shared visions of national security, job creation in the U.S. and sustainable energy.\" Kammen did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Kammen wrapped up his resignation letter with something of a warning for Trump, borrowing the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower: \"A people [or person] that values its privileges above principles soon loses both.\" Trump's response to Charlottesville has cost him the support of a slew of business leaders and Hollywood performers who resigned from various presidential advisory groups. Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, was the first member to quit the president's American Manufacturing Council, on August 14, citing \"a matter of personal conscience\" and \"a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\" Trump quickly rebuked him on Twitter. Over the next few days, several more executives followed Frazier's lead, prompting Trump to lash out at them as \"grandstanders\" who could easily be replaced. Before the end of the week, both the manufacturing council and the president's Strategy & Policy Forum had been disbanded. Though Trump announced publicly it was his decision to end both councils, those close to the process, including JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, said the groups had already decided to disband. Last Friday, the members of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities announced they were resigning en masse in a fiery letter. \"Ignoring your hateful rhetoric would have made us complicit in your words and actions . . .\" the letter stated. \"Supremacy, discrimination, and vitriol are not American values.

Photo: V. Sudershan A Delhi court on Wednesday fixed September 14 as the date for framing of charges against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia in a criminal defamation case. Personal appearance Metropolitan Magistrate Vijay Kumar Jha had earlier allowed Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia’s plea for exemption from personal appearance. Assembly polls The other accused in the case is Swaraj Abhiyan president Yogendra Yadav. Mr. Yadav was in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) when the case was filed. The complainant, former Shahdara Bar Association secretary Surender Sharma, had alleged that he was asked by the AAP to contest the Delhi Assembly elections in 2013 but later read an article in a leading daily quoting a party statement claiming that he was being replaced since he had criminal cases pending against him. ‘Defamatory remarks’ “The press release published in newspapers as well as testimonies of witnesses reflect that defamatory remarks were published in newspapers, which affected the reputation of the complainant in society and lowered his reputation in the eyes of other members of society,” the court had said while summoning the three leaders. The court had summoned them under Sections 499, 500 (defamation) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC, saying there was prima facie material to summon the accused.

    "description": "Ranking Austin Peay&apos;s best chances to win in 2017",
    "content": "APSU SPORTS Ranking Austin Peay's best chances to win in 2017 Colton Pouncy USA TODAY NETWORK — Tennessee The Austin Peay football team owns the country's longest losing streak, currently sitting at 27 games. The streak spans across parts of three seasons and two coaching staffs, with the last victory coming in October 2014. But with an emerging young roster, the No. 1 recruiting class in FCS football and another year of growth for second-year head coach Will Healy, this could finally be the year the Governors end the streak. Here's a look at their best chances of doing so. 1. Morehead State; Saturday, Sept. 16 @ 6:00 p.m. 2016 record: 4-7 Morehead State serves as Austin Peay's best shot at a victory. It will be the Governors' first home game of the season after spending the first two weeks in Ohio. But more importantly, the team is tired of hearing about the losing streak, and if Austin Peay falls to 0-2 to start the season, this game against Morehead State — picked to finish eighth in the Pioneer Football League preseason poll — offers one of the legitimate chances for victory on the schedule. If everything goes to plan, this could be Healy's first victory as Austin Peay's head coach. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. 2. Southeast Missouri State; Saturday, Oct 21 @ 4:00 p.m. 2016 record: 3-8; 3-5 in OVC SEMO only won three games last year, so the gap between them and Austin Peay isn't that wide. And last year's game, a 41-21 Austin Peay loss, was JaVaugh Craig's second career start and first on the road. With some more game experience under his belt, Craig and what should be an improved Austin Peay offense will be in this game. 3. Murray State; Saturday, Sept. 23 @ 6:00 p.m. 2016 record: 4-7; 4-4 in OVC Murray State was the last team Austin Peay defeated, back in October 2014. Out of the nine football teams in the OVC, Murray State was picked to finish eighth in the OVC preseason poll, just ahead of Austin Peay. If this truly is a matchup of the two worst teams in the conference, APSU certainly has a shot. Murray State will have to replace star quarterback KD Humphries, who capped off his collegiate career with 10,458 passing yards, the second-most passing yards in OVC history. Replacing a guy like Humphries on a team that only won four games a year ago doesn't bode well for its 2017 chances, and that could work in Austin Peay's favor. 4. Eastern Kentucky; Saturday, Nov. 11 @ 12:00 p.m. 2016 record: 3-8; 2-6 in OVC Last year was a rare down year for Eastern Kentucky, having won at least six games every season since 2010 prior to 2016's 3-8 campaign. But Eastern Kentucky, like a lot of teams on this list, managed to take care of business against APSU a year ago, winning by a score of 67-30. APSU running back Kentel Williams broke the team's all-purpose single-game record in this meeting last year, but that was pretty much the only bright spot in the game for the Governors. Austin Peay's defense allowed 67 points and 531 yards of offense. This goes without saying, but they'll need to improve upon those numbers to have a realistic shot in 2017. 5. Tennessee Tech; Saturday, Nov. 4 @ 1:30 p.m. 2016 record: 5-6; 5-3 in OVC Despite a 5-6 overall record, Tennessee Tech finished third in the OVC with a 5-3 record in conference play. That includes a 41-7 beat-down of Austin Peay in Clarksville. APSU's roster as a whole looks immensely different since that matchup, so don't expect to see another 34-point loss. 6. Eastern Illinois; Saturday, Nov. 18 @ 4:00 p.m. 2016 record: 6-5; 4-4 in OVC While the program doesn't have Tony Romo or Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback this season, a full year from Syracuse transfer Mitch Kimble could help. When healthy last season, Kimble was serviceable, throwing for 13 touchdowns in seven games. Although he didn't play in Eastern Illinois' 56-35 win against APSU in 2016, he could emerge as one of the better quarterbacks in the conference this season. This matchup will be the final game of the regular season for Austin Peay, and a win could really give the program a bit of momentum heading into the offseason. 7. Tennessee State; Saturday, Oct. 14 @  6:00 p.m. 2016 record: 7-4; 4-3 in OVC If not for a touchdown and made extra point with 1.7 seconds left in last year's matchup, there probably wouldn't be a story about Austin Peay's best shot a victory in 2017. But the crushing 41-40 loss to Tennessee State still shows up in the record books. The good news: APSU's JaVaugn Craig torched TSU's defense, passing for 322 yards and five touchdowns and running for another 144 yards in the game. If he plays like that again, Austin Peay could hang around. But Tennessee State looks to be improved, adding former Florida dual-threat quarterback Treon Harris to the mix for 2017. Tennessee State will be heavily favored in its homecoming game. 8. Tennessee-Martin; Saturday, Sept. 30 vs 6:00 p.m. 2016 record: 7-5; 6-2 in OVC UT-Martin finished second in the OVC last year behind Jacksonville State, and that's where the Skyhawks are projected to finish again in 2017. Will Healy's team made some strides late last season and only lost last year's matchup by 14 points, but UT-Martin will again be one of the top teams in the OVC. APSU's performance against UT-Martin will be a good barometer of the rebuilding progress, though. 9. Miami (Ohio); Saturday, Sept. 9 @ 2:30 p.m. 2016 record: 6-7 The story of Miami's 2016 season is a tale of two halves. The Redhawks started the year 0-6, and it looked like another 2 or 3 win season was on the horizon for third-year head coach Chuck Martin. But Miami hit its stride in the second half of the season, winning its final six regular season games to reach bowl eligibility for the first time since 2010, eventually losing to Mississippi State in the St. Petersburg Bowl. Quarterback Gus Ragland was a huge part of that turnaround, returning from a torn ACL to throw 17 touchdowns and one interception over the team's final seven games. He'll return in 2017, and Austin Peay's young defense could struggle against the proven quarterback. 10. Jacksonville State; Saturday, Oct. 7 @ 4:00 p.m. 2016 record: 10-2; 7-0 in OVC Jacksonville State was picked to repeat as OVC Champions in the preseason poll, receiving 13 first-place points and 141 points overall. The team is 23-0 in OVC play the past three seasons, but last year's 34-14 victory over the Governors was one of Austin Peay's closer games of the season. But Jacksonville State returns eight starters from a defensive unit that finished fourth nationally in total defense and seventh in scoring defense. Among those returners is preseason OVC Defensive Player of the Year Darius Jackson. Austin Peay's offense could be in line for a rough day against this OVC powerhouse program. 11. Cincinnati; Thursday, Aug. 31 @ 6:00 p.m. 2016 record: 4-8 Cincinnati and Austin Peay will meet in the season opener Thursday, Aug. 31. Historically, this matchup hasn't been too kind to the Governors, losing all five previous games including a 72-10 loss in 2011. The Bearcats enter the 2017 season with a new head coach leading the way, hiring longtime Ohio State assistant coach Luke Fickle in December. Even coming off of a 4-8 season, Cincinnati's roster has more talent than APSU's from top to bottom. Don't expect this to be the one for coach Healy, but if the team can keep it relatively close, it could boost team morale for the rest of the season. It's not quite a victory, but it's something.

Read our privacy notice . This is the shocking moment a driver reversed a car and rammed into a police vehicle twice on a busy road. Footage released by police shows a silver Mitsubishi Shogun speeding backwards towards the car, hitting it at speed and forcing it backwards into the vehicle behind.

    "content": "Gaming Xbox Xbox One X roars past PlayStation 4 Pro on Amazon's 2017 Best Sellers list in just a few days News By Jez Corden last updated 25 August 2017 The Xbox One X, described by Microsoft as a \"monster\" console, is already doing extremely well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works . My own retail sources told me that Xbox One X stock was largely projected to last a week, but in many cases, the 4K console is already sold out at various retailers around the world. Of course, that could simply indicate that stock was limited, but the early signs bode well for Microsoft. Here's another pretty great early sign: In a matter of days, the Xbox One X has already overtaken its closest competition, the PlayStation 4 (PS4) Pro, on the Amazon U.S. 2017 Best Sellers list. First noticed by Niko Partners Analyst Daniel Ahmad, the Xbox One X is already on-pace to beat the PS4 Pro on Amazon for 2017 , despite the PS4 Pro being on sale for the entirety of the year, vs. the few days since the Xbox One X pre-orders got announced. You may like Xbox Series X review (2025): Microsoft says everything is an Xbox, but the Xbox Series X remains at the apex of the Microsoft Gaming ecosystem Microsoft's Surface Pro meets Nintendo's Switch 2 in this absurd Evangelion-inspired gaming handheld — and it's ludicrously expensive Xbox just made the best console version of Forza Horizon 5 yet — for the PS5 Pro Xbox One X pre orders seem to be doing well on Amazon. Already ahead of PS4 Pro on Amazon US for 2017 YTD. pic.twitter.com/qarehlgvNS Xbox One X pre orders seem to be doing well on Amazon. Already ahead of PS4 Pro on Amazon US for 2017 YTD. pic.twitter.com/qarehlgvNS — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) 23 August 2017 23 August 2017 Sales success on Amazon US is a pretty good indicator that other retailers are seeing similar figures, and while this still doesn't give us any indication on actual sales figures, it does show that the Xbox One X is off to a roaring start. Reportedly , roughly 20% of current PlayStation 4 sales are of the suped-up \"Pro\" edition, which powers resolutions above HD, occasionally reaching 4K. The Xbox One X offers 50% more power to help developers hit 4K resolutions more often, while throwing in other graphics enhancements such as improved draw distances, textures, and much more . PlayStation 4 continues to be a sales success story for Sony, so if the Xbox One X has managed to outpace the total 2017 Amazon US sales of PS4 Pro in mere days , that can only be interpreted as good news for Microsoft.

    "content": "AP Why ESPN and Robert Lee are right By Roxanne Jones Aug 23, 2017 Aug 23, 2017 Updated Aug 23, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save In the testosterone-laced world of sports, sometimes your name means everything. Think not? I've seen men beaten by mobs just for having the gall to scream out \"let's go Cowboys\" at an Eagles game. Think of all the racial epithets we've heard, of how one football player, Colin Kaepernick, silently taking a knee during the national anthem in personal protest of injustice in America has divided the nation. We want to pretend that sports are a safe sanctuary from the world's ugly problems, but that has always been a farce. Truth is, not even the glorious game of football can keep America's toxic culture of bigotry, hate and violence at bay. It's just too heavy a burden. So imagine if you're scheduled to be the announcer for ESPN's livestream of the University of Virginia's season-opener football game against William and Mary in a few weeks and your name is Robert Lee. But you have watched , along with the world, as thousands of torch-wielding, white supremacists screaming hate-filled chants marched around the UVA campus and rallied all their hate at the foot of a statue bearing your name: Robert Lee. A monument the city had voted to remove under state objections. Well, it's not unreasonable, even though you are Asian-American, that you — and your employer — may have some concerns.

It was about the reasonable possibility that because of his name he would be subjected to memes and jokes and who knows what else. Think about it. Robert Lee comes to town to do a game in Charlottesville,\" ESPN said in a statement that was tweeted late Tuesday night. \"No politically correct efforts. No race issues. Just trying to be supportive of a young guy who felt it best to avoid the potential zoo.\" It was a mutual decision, the network says, to switch Lee to the Youngstown State versus Pittsburgh game that same day. Nope, not unreasonable at all. Not in today's America. Not when we just witnessed heavily armed, swastika-wearing protesters who believe in white supremacy clashing in the streets with counterprotesters, who believed just as passionately that all people are created equal. Not when one woman is dead and dozens more injured because they had the audacity to stand up to the failed notion of white supremacy. Not when a statue, or a team name, or a presidential tweet can incite racial tensions and violence. No matter that Robert Lee is Asian-American and his name has nothing to do with the Confederacy or slavery. It seems unreasonable, ignorant and downright ridiculous to associate his name in any way with the Confederate general. Still, nothing we've witnessed in Charlottesville, or since, has been reasonable or intelligent. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts Nothing we've seen in Charlottesville or other cities and towns where these types of protests and counterprotests have sprung up could be called reasonable. It's disgusting. Killing one another, fighting, chanting Nazi slogans and counterslogans. Still, it continues. We continue. As racial tensions over police brutality, immigration and other issues have flared over the past several years in our nation, these statues have become lightning rods — symbolizing oppression, hate and the whitewashing of history for many of us, myself included. Others insist these monuments, of which there are dozens across the nation, are a symbol of Southern pride, an important part of American history. Right. If that were the case, wouldn't we also have numerous statues of Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey or Harriet Tubman and countless others who fought for freedom and equality standing proudly outside government buildings, dotting college campuses? Just getting a national monument to Martin Luther King Jr. took decades . Long before the Charlottesville riots, municipalities had begun to remove these Confederate monuments on public property, citing safety issues. And those efforts have increased since Charlottesville. From Baltimore to Brooklyn to Texas , these statues are toppling amid protest. While this national conversation continues, ESPN decided to avoid evoking the chaos during a live broadcast. Robert Lee decided he just wanted to do his job, which is to broadcast a livestream of a college football game. As one ESPN executive told me Wednesday: \"Let's not go to the zoo if we don't have to go to the zoo.\" Good call. Life is crazy enough already. 0 Comments Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!

    "content": "New Yorkers Mourn End Of An Era As 'Village Voice' Ceases Print Edition By Camila Domonoske Published August 23, 2017 at 1:49 PM MDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Flipboard Drew Angerer / Getty Images A Village Voice newspaper stand lays on the ground next to garbage in New York City's East Village on Tuesday. The Village Voice , one of the oldest and best-known alternative weeklies in the U.S., announced that it will no longer publish a print edition. You can swipe. You can scroll. But New Yorkers will no longer be able to flip through The Village Voice . This week, the legendary alternative weekly announced that it's ending its free paper version. In a press release distributed Tuesday, the publication said it plans to maintain its digital platform and continue to host events but will no longer be printing paper copies. The Voice had been in print for more than six decades and recently had a distribution of some 120,000 copies each week. It's the latest twist of the knife for a publication that has already seen round after round of layoffs , including of some of its best-known and most-beloved reporters and critics. The Village Voice was exposing Donald Trump when no one else was paying attention. pic.twitter.com/UvmzMpGheS — John Nichols (@NicholsUprising) August 22, 2017 And the news has been met with mourning and nostalgia in some corners of the New York media world (and beyond). Again. \"It's an NYC media tradition nearly as rich as the personal essay on leaving New York : Announce the Voice has betrayed you; memorialize her finer days; and declare her, as did the deserter before you, dead in grit and relevance,\" Simone Wilson wrote on Patch.com . Everyone agrees that in its heyday, the Voice was vibrant, energetic, essential, contrarian, contradictory, cantankerous and quintessentially New York. But nobody can agree on when, exactly, those glory days ended. \"For Voice devotees, the golden age was always the one just past,\" The New York Times writes . The Internet revolutionized classified advertising, sending shock waves through newspapers all across the country, including free alt weeklies. \"The business has moved online — and so has the Voice 's audience, which expects us to do what we do not just once a week, but every day, across a range of media, from words and pictures to podcasts, video and even other forms of print publishing,\" Voice owner Peter Barbey said in Tuesday's statement. Barbey purchased the alt weekly in 2015, amid scandal, as NPR's David Folkenflik reported at the time. \"Weekly papers are financially troubled these days, undermined by drops in readership, advertising and relevance,\" David said. \"For Village Voice and its sister papers one financial bright spot has been Backpage.com, an online classified ads site — but it has been denounced by religious activists, a U.S. senator and New York Times columnist Nick Kristof for enabling child prostitution. Backpage says it has spent much time and millions of dollars to ensure that its classifieds involve only legal activities and consenting adults, but the headaches endured.\" The legal struggles over Backpage continue ; prosecutors accuse the site of actively participating in prostitution, while Backpage says the ongoing pressure on its business amounts to \"unconstitutional government censorship.\" But now the ownership of the Village Voice and Backpage have been separated, and the alt weekly no longer \"solicits or accepts\" sex ads, according to the paper's statement. After investing in the print publication, upping the number of copies and improving the paper quality, Barbey is now shutting it off altogether. You can see an archive of old Voice editions over at Google . And you can also buy hundreds of old copies on eBay ... or, of course, on Craigslist . Copyright 2021 NPR.

    "content": "What Our Monuments (Don't) Teach Us About Remembering The Past By Leah Donnella , Kat Chow , Gene Demby Published August 23, 2017 at 1:02 PM MDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Flipboard Listen • 31:25 Joe Raedle / Getty Images The past few weeks have revitalized debates across the country about what role Confederate monuments play in commemorating U.S. history. As the debate rages over what role Confederate monuments do — and should — play in commemorating U.S. history, Jennifer Allen says we can learn a lot from Germany. Allen is an assistant professor of German history at Yale University, and she specializes in something called memory politics. She also attended the University of Virginia, located in Charlottesville, where violent clashes earlier this month over a statue of Robert E. Lee brought this debate back into the national spotlight. The way people understand history, Allen says, is constantly evolving. And the discussions about monuments and the Confederacy, she says, are an opportunity for the U.S. to reimagine its relationship to the past. / Courtesy of Jennifer Allen / Courtesy of Jennifer Allen Jennifer Allen is a professor in the Department of History at Yale University. We talked with Allen this week about why the objects we use to remember history are so meaningful and what the experience of Germany can teach us. Here is an edited version of our conversation. You were a student at the University of Virginia. What were your feelings about the Robert E. Lee monument in Charlottesville back then? I'm embarrassed to admit this: I lived just down the street from the Robert E. Lee memorial and I must have walked past it dozens of times and never gave it a moment of thought. Incidentally, not four blocks away from that, there is another monument — even more inconspicuous in Charlottesville's court square. A small plaque, embedded in the ground, that marks the site of a former slave auction. And I also walked past that countless times and did not pay attention to it at all. Monuments don't mean things on their own. They mean things because we make them mean things. So this Robert E. Lee statue, which I suspect most Charlottesvillians would have walked past and ignored as well, has taken on a new valence. And I think that's an important reminder. Monuments are not static things that have a single narrative behind them. Monuments are things that we create. Monuments are objects whose meaning and significance we create daily. In the wake of Charlottesville, a lot of comparisons have been made between the way the United States commemorates slavery and the way Germany commemorates the Holocaust. So how has Germany dealt with its role in the Holocaust? I think Germany is a really fascinating case study in the depths of human depravity and also the resilience of the human spirit. The German case is interesting, and complex, and it has gone through many transformations. The Nuremberg trials are sort of the first important moment of reckoning, but also a complicated one. Part of what the trials did was identify a very select group of perpetrators. So it allowed one to say, \" They were the ones who did this. Not me.\" The first big transition that you see in West Germany's attempt to reckon with the legacy of the Holocaust was in the '60s, with the so-called \"generation of '68,\" who revolted against their parents. Who said \"no, you've been too silent.\" That's a kind of second generation of reckoning. Those are the children of the perpetrators [of the Holocaust.] And now you're getting into a generation of grandchildren and of great-grandchildren, and I think that moment is where you start to see a sort of qualitative re-evaluation of the kind of forms memory and commemoration might take. What can that teach us about reckoning with the history of slavery in the United States? I think what we're looking at right now is a kind of belated — one might say very belated — attempt to think through, yet again, what monuments to the Confederacy mean. How the United States wants to commemorate black history, African-American history, because really that's what this comes back to, in the kind of \"post-Ferguson\" moment. Memory is not just the things that we recall on a moment-to-moment basis. Memory is something that also means something in the world; what we decide is important to remember is something that is collectively determined, and the politics, the negotiation, the conversation by which we determine what matters and what doesn't. Politics is a process of negotiation. So is the conversation over what should be memorialized, what should go in a museum, what should take the form of a monument, what should be a holiday. All of these things we sometimes take for granted. We take for granted that we celebrate the Fourth of July. But what we're seeing right now unfolding in the wake of Charlottesville is that, for example, commemorating the Confederacy is not something we should take for granted. It is something that is, in fact, debatable. You mentioned that large grass-roots movement in Germany to commemorate victims of the Holocaust, often driven in part by the descendants of perpetrators of the Holocaust. Why isn't there the same momentum in the United States to commemorate enslaved people? The banal answer is that race relations are still very complicated in the United States. And the question of responsibility for commemorating the human aspects of slavery — that is, slavery not as an institution. To commemorate the Confederacy is to think, at most, abstractly about the way that slavery tied into that heritage. And I think with each successive generation, it has become more and more difficult to reckon with the question of responsibility. You see this play out in the debates about reparations. In the German context, the Germans jumped immediately to make reparations to the Jews, to Israel, to other victims of the Holocaust. And we just never had that conversation. The further away you get, I think, there's a sense of distance. \"I didn't own slaves. My parents didn't own slaves. My grandparents didn't own slaves. So why is this my responsibility?\" Or, \"I am an open, tolerant person. Why should I carry that burden?\" And I think that conversation is changing, too, as people — particularly the white American population — think about privilege in new ways. I think as people re-evaluate what their relationship is to people who carry the institution of slavery in a different way, namely black Americans, I think conversations about how to commemorate that event, as a human event, also change.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The NAACP on Wednesday called for a meeting with the NFL to discuss the fate of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality against African-Americans. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback once took his team to the Super Bowl, but he’s a free agent now and no club has signed him. Some Kaepernick opponents say he should not have sat or kneeled during the anthem, while others contend his lack of a job is more about his on-field talent. Kaepernick’s supporters, including some who planned to protest at the NFL’s headquarters in New York City on Wednesday, say the quarterback is being blackballed for his advocacy. The NAACP intended to join that rally, and Derrick Johnson, the organization’s interim president and CEO, said in the letter to the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, that it’s apparently “no sheer coincidence” that Kaepernick isn’t on a roster today. “No player should be victimized and discriminated against because of his exercise of free speech — to do so is in violation of his rights under the Constitution and the NFL’s own regulations,” Johnson said. Hazel Dukes, the NAACP’s state president in New York who was expected to be among the rally speakers, said: “Right now, the action of the league seems to imply to young Black men that this league, which is comprised of 70 percent African-Americans, only values Black lives if they are wearing a football uniform.” Tags NFL commissioner San Francisco 49ers",

    "content": "By Lucas Ropek | lropek@repub.com NORTHAMPTON - An 87-year-old Greenfield woman was taken for treatment at Cooley Dickinson Medical Center Wednesday after being involved in a rollover crash in Northampton, police said. Massachusetts State Trooper Paul Sullivan said State Police were called to the area of Route I-91 near the Exit 20 off ramp at 10:16 a.m. after a call came in for a rollover crash at that location. At the scene police found a 2016 Jeep Compass that had rolled over. Only one vehicle was involved in the crash, and the operator was the sole occupant of the Jeep, Sullivan said. She is expected to be okay, he said. Police are still investigating why the crash occurred. Police could not provide further details on the crash or the extent of damage to the vehicle, though initial media reports stated that there was heavy front end damage and that a \"Wrong Way\" sign looked as if it had been \"bent down to the ground\" during the course of the accident. The Jeep was towed from the scene and the area of the crash was cleared by 10:50 a.m., Sullivan said.

    "content": "News, events, and other notes from Ravelry.com Many in the US spent Monday looking skyward from behind special glasses as a total eclipse made its way across the country. Other countries were able to see it, as well, though mostly as a partial eclipse. It was really fun to see all of the posts online about people excitedly experiencing this phenomenon and this excitement was also seen in Ravelry projects. I thought I would share a few! This Solar Eclipse Amigurumi by ellafofella was the first eclipse project to catch my eye. What a cute way to commemorate the day! I love a good garland, and this Solar Eclipse garland by DebbieDianne is no exception! These coasters and dishcloths are so fun! From left to right: RaeA’s Happy Solar Eclipse Coast-er Coast Day , vibeskat’s Solar eclipse coaster and BellaSeesStars’ Solar Eclipse Dishcloth Then there were a few projects that were more indirectly related to the eclipse. On the left we have bdrx’s Idaho Total Solar Eclipse 2017! I love the picture of her finished hat with the solar eclipse glasses. Then, in the middle is knitstina’s Invisible Sun , made to celebrate the solar eclipse. Finally, on the right, are tyedyediva’s Solar Eclipse Socks with bright toes and a speckled yarn. I love how crafters find a way to mark a time in their lives with things that they make, whether they are big or small! Where the total eclipse was visible, it only lasted for a few minutes, but these knitters and crocheters will have the finished items featured here as a reminder of that day.",

    "content": "Now 81 Wed 64 Thu 70 by JOE MANDAK, Associated Press PITTSBURGH (AP) — Bruno Mars has met the man he's nicknamed after: former pro wrestling champion Bruno Sammartino. The two met Tuesday night when the pop singing sensation's 24K Magic World Tour stopped in Pittsburgh.  Sammartino heard through friends that Mars, born Peter Gene Hernandez, was nicknamed \"Bruno\" by his father because he was a \"chunky\" baby. The wrestling legend — now 81 — was about 275 pounds in his prime and the favorite wrestler of Mars' father. Sammartino told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he didn't know much about Mars before the meeting, but came away \"extremely impressed.\" \"I hope he's like that in everyday life. He was the most humble, nicest guy,\" Sammartino said. \"He couldn't have been more respectful.\" Sammartino jokingly gave Mars a picture of himself in his wrestling \"prime\" to prove he was more muscular than chunky, and a replica of his championship belt from what was then known as the World-Wide Wrestling Federation. The group is now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE. Mars posted a picture of the meeting on Instagram saying, \"I was nicknamed after this professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino. Tonight in Pittsburgh I had the honor of meeting him!\" Mars, 31, told the website RapUP in a May 2010 interview that his dad nicknamed him for the wrestler. \"Bruno is after Bruno Sammartino, who was this big fat wrestler. I guess I was this chunky little baby, so my dad used to call me that as a nickname,\" Mars said. \"The Mars came up just because I felt like I didn't have no pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I'm out of this world, so I was like 'I guess I'm from Mars.'\" Sammartino said Mars got curious enough about his career to check out clips of him in YouTube. He told Sammartino that he planned to chat with his father about the meeting. \"He told me, 'You know, I called my dad and told him I was going to meet with you today and he was so excited,\" Sammartino said",

In 2018, the park will operate 365 days per year. By Sandra Barrera | sbarrera@scng.com | Daily News UPDATED: September 10, 2017 at 11:01 PM PDT There’s nothing Joshua Tabor hates more than not getting to put his Six Flags Magic Mountain season pass to use because the theme park isn’t open on the day his 14-year-old son happens to be on a break from school. But that’s about to change. On Jan. 1, the Valencia-based amusement park that dubs itself the “Thrill Capital of the World” will switch to a year-round daily schedule, joining the ranks of other Southern California attractions such as Disneyland and Disney California Adventure, Knott’s Berry Farm and Universal Studios Hollywood. “Knowing that an amusement park is available as an option of something to do greatly enhances my chances of visiting more often,” said Tabor, a 40-year-old single dad from Desert Hot Springs. The new operating calendar gives visitors like Tabor unlimited opportunities to experience the theme park’s 19 roller coasters, 100-plus rides, shows, and attractions such as the new “Justice League: Battle for Metropolis.” Fans took to social media Wednesday morning to share their excitement about the news that next year will bring 365 days of thrills. “Yes! Now I can go during the school year and maybe not waste my day in line,” Jamie Foster-Dean of Arizona posted on the theme park’s Facebook page. “When I travel in from out of state it isn’t really worth it, but now!” Six Flags Magic Mountain attracted more than 3.3 million visitors in 2016, a 7.3 percent increase in attendance from the previous year, according to an annual attendance study published by the Themed Entertainment Association and the global construction firm AECOM in June. The report attributed the increase to “the growth of tourism to the Los Angeles area and improvements to the park, including the addition of VR to The New Revolution ride.” That report also said that Universal Studios had 8.1 million visitors, Disneyland netted 17.9 million, Disney California Adventure had 9.3 million and Knott’s Berry Farm had 4 million. Six Flags Magic Mountain wants in on the booming theme park tourism market. New events are planned for the additional 100 days of the operating calendar, making it “a thrilling vacation option to both international and domestic visitors coming to enjoy Southern California,” Jim Reid-Anderson, chairman, president and CEO of Six Flags Entertainment Corporation said in a press release. The park’s fans expressed concern on social media about whether the new schedule will bring an increase in the price of tickets or season passes. But Six Flags Magic Mountain spokeswoman Connie Lujan said “as of now, prices are not changing. “We are a great value,” she said.

Photo: Charles Mostoller for The Intercept A new bill introduced by seven Pennsylvania Republican state lawmakers could force protesters arrested at demonstrations to pay for police overtime and other fees related to the action. The bill, SB 754, has been introduced by Rep. Scott Martin of Lancaster County; his district has been the site of anti-pipeline protests aimed at the Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline. Under the terms of the bill, “a person is responsible for public safety response costs incurred by a State agency or political subdivision as a result of the State agency’s or political subdivision’s response to a demonstration if, in connection with the demonstration, the person is convicted of a felony or misdemeanor offense.” In other words, they could be on the hook for costs, such as police overtime, medical or emergency response, or other basic public services associated with protests. Whatever felony or misdemeanor offense the protester was convicted of would come with its own independent penalty. Elizabeth Randol, the legislative director at the Pennsylvania American Civil Liberties Union, raised two separate concerns about the bill. First, she warned, it could end up punishing protesters for acts they didn’t commit. “People can be fined and charged, liable for costs associated with a particular crime they committed. That’s normal,” she noted. “What’s different is that it expands it … to allow the government entity, like say, a state or it could be the National Guard, it could be the police department, to determine, to leave it up to them as to whether or not they want to attempt to recover additional costs that are associated with the protest but that are not necessarily related to the specific crime that the individual was convicted of.” She also warned that the legislation singles out protesters. After all, police and emergency personnel respond to all sorts of situations. “Public protests are very strictly protected in constitutional law,” Randol noted. “We’re all sensitive to costs and to what that does to a tax bill or the kind of stress and strain it puts on our first responders. But you can’t have those costs be borne on the back of people who are protesting and engaging in their First Amendment protected rights to speech and assembly.” The text of the legislation is not subtle about being inspired by anti-pipeline protests. It includes a lengthy section laying out the costs associated with the demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota — citing specific figures, such as the “331,721 hours of response support” by local police and National Guard and a $38.2 million price tag for local and state taxpayers. DeSmog Blog notes that Martin has close ties to pipeline lobbyists. Prior to joining the Pennsylvania Senate, Martin worked for a firm called Community Networking Strategies. CNS is a subsidiary of the lobbying firm, McNees, Wallace & Nurick — which lobbies for Gulf Oil Ltd, Industrial Energy Consumers of Pennsylvania, and Sunoco Logistics. Sunoco Logistics is a company working on the Mariner East 2 pipeline , another Pennsylvania-based project that demonstrators have besieged. The company involved with the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, Transco, hired the Pennsylvania Advocacy Group last year for consulting work; the Pennsylvania Advocacy Group was created in part by two lobbyists who worked at CNS. Martin didn’t respond to a request for comment.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Aramazd Andressian Sr., 35, pleaded guilty earlier this month in Los Angeles County Superior Court to first-degree murder in the April death of his son after a family trip to Disneyland. Andressian smothered his son, Aramazd Andressian Jr., with a child's jacket in his car, sheriff's Detective Louie Aguilera said after the hearing Wednesday, the first time investigators divulged how the boy died. Aguilera said the boy was killed about an hour after he and his father arrived in Santa Barbara, and his body was left in a wooded area near Vista Point. \"I hope you relive the image of murdering my baby every day of your insignificant life,\" the boy's mother, Ana Estevez, told Andressian just before he was sentenced. \"May your dark soul burn in eternal hell,\" she said. Estevez also called her husband a failure as a father, a man and a human being. \"There is no real pain, just an incomprehensible deadness. Like my son, I, too, have died,\" she said. Andressian did not speak during the hearing. He pleaded guilty partly to avoid the possibility of prosecutors adding a charge that could result in the death penalty, his attorney has said. Authorities have said Andressian killed his son in a plot to get back at his wife. Sheriff's investigators believe the boy was killed on April 21. His father was found passed out in a park the next morning, sparking an intensive search for the boy. Andressian had taken prescription pills and was found in a car doused in gasoline in an apparent suicide attempt, sheriff's officials have said. Investigators searched for more than two months before they found the boy's body on June 30 near Lake Cachuma outside Santa Barbara — about 145 miles (233 kilometers) away from Anaheim, where Disneyland is located. Andressian's attorney, Ambrosio Rodriguez, has repeatedly declined to comment when asked why Andressian killed his son but has said the killing was \"not planned.\" Rodriguez has said his client told investigators where to find his son's remains and regrets killing the boy. A report by the county Department of Children and Family Services obtained by The Associated Press said the boy's skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in Santa Ynez. The report described the boy as being the victim of \"physical and severe neglect.\" DAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day By clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .",

    "content": "US Girl Scouts accuse Boy Scouts of covertly recruiting girls Associated Press Published August 23, 2017 5:30pm EDT | Updated September 25, 2017 7:39pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email NEW YORK – Inflaming a century-old and mostly cordial rivalry, the president of the Girl Scouts of the USA is accusing the Boy Scouts of seeking to covertly recruit girls into their programs while disparaging the Girl Scouts' operations. \"I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 percent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts ... and not consider expanding to recruit girls,\" wrote GSUSA President Kathy Hopinkah Hannan in a letter sent this week to the president of the Boy Scouts of America, Randall Stephenson. Top leaders of the two youth organizations, both struggling to stem membership declines, conferred this month about possibilities for coordination. But Hopinkah Hannan, in her letter, said she came away from that discussion feeling the Boy Scouts had already committed to an expansion of coed programs that would damage the Girl Scouts. The tough tone of her letter dismayed Boy Scout leaders, said BSA spokeswoman Effie Delimarkos. \"We are disheartened to see the Girl Scouts pull away from the possibility of cooperation to help address the needs of today's busy families,\" she said Wednesday. The Boy Scouts have some coed programs dating back nearly 50 years, but this year there has been extensive discussion within the BSA community about expanding opportunities for girls beyond existing coed programs, such as Venturing and Sea Scouts. No final decisions have been made, Delimarkos said, stressing that boys-only programs would remain at the core of the organization. However, she said, the BSA — in response to requests from families — \"has been exploring the benefits of bringing Scouting to every member of the family — boys and girls.\" To the Girl Scouts, such exploration amounted to a show of disrespect. \"Despite offering to engage in a constructive, collaborative sharing process, we were disappointed in the lack of transparency as we learned that you are surreptitiously testing the appeal of a girls' offering to millennial parents,\" Hopinkah Hannan said. She also expressed concern about \"aggressive posturing by Boy Scout leaders towards Girl Scout leaders\" at recent meetings outlining the proposed girls program to interested families. \"This includes everything from disparaging and untrue remarks about Girl Scout programming, to subtle implications about the weakness of Girl Scouts' long term market strength,\" her letter said. \"I implore you to condemn this behavior within your organization and to create consequences for these actions.\" The letter was first reported by BuzzFeed News. Delimarkos, in response, said the BSA, as an organization, has never disparaged the Girl Scouts and deeply respects its programs. \"Considering how many young girls and boys are not currently served by either of our programs, we believe we owe it to families to explore how we may be able to structure program offerings that fit into their busy lives to deliver character development and values-based leadership training,\" Delimarkos added. The Girl Scouts, founded in 1912, and the BSA, founded in 1910, are among several major youth organizations in the U.S. experiencing sharp drops in membership in recent years. Reasons include competition from youth sports leagues, a perception by some families that they are old-fashioned, and busy schedules that prompt some parents to despair of meeting all their children's obligations. For some families, coed scouting programs could be a welcome convenience. As of March, GSUSA reported 1,566,671 youth members and 749,008 adult members, down from just over 2 million youth members and about 800,000 adult members in 2014. The Boy Scouts say current youth participation is about 2.35 million, down from 2.6 million in 2013 and more than 4 million in peak years of the past. In February, the National Organization for Women issued a statement urging the Boy Scouts to allow girls to join. NOW said it was inspired by the efforts of a 15-year-old New York City girl, Sydney Ireland, to emulate her older brother, who is an Eagle Scout. Unlike the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts have maintained girls-only status for all their programs; the empowerment of girls is at the core of its mission. \"We know that girls learn best in an all-girl, girl-led environment,\" says Andrea Bastiani Archibald, a psychologist who provides expertise on development for the Girl Scouts' national programming. For at least the past decade, the Girl Scout community in the U.S. has been racked by internal debate over that programming. Some alumni have suggested there is an overemphasis on the sale of Girl Scout cookies and on academic-style programs, sometimes at the expense of robust outdoor activities. The GSUSA's newly appointed CEO, Sylvia Acevedo, who holds an engineering degree, says she wants to strike a balance. In October, the Girl Scouts are planning to host a three-day summit in Columbus, Ohio, that it describes as \"the largest girl-led event in the world.\" An agenda drafted by high school girls is expected to cover such topics as career planning, healthy relationships and overcoming adversity. ___ Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/CraryAP True Crime The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

Authorities say 27-year-old David Wright plotted with Rhode Island resident Nicholas Rovinski and another man to kill blogger Pamela Geller. The plot was never carried out. Rovinski pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges last year. The Boston Globe reports prosecutors included in court papers Tuesday a sworn statement from an FBI agent saying Wright told the prisoner \"neither 'Nick' nor his family was safe.\" Prosecutors say Wright previously told the informant he would behead anyone who betrayed him by giving information police. Wright's lawyers didn't immediately respond to a request seeking comment on Wednesday. ___ Information from: The Boston Globe, http://www.bostonglobe.com True Crime The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

    "content": "Login Vlad 23 August 2017 Samsung Android Deals The Galaxy Note8 became official today , as you may know. It's a pretty special device not just because of its near-bezelless screen or because it's the first Samsung phone to sport a dual rear camera setup. It's also the successor to the exploding Galaxy Note7 from last year, which got discontinued after two recalls. Samsung remembers that fiasco, and the company is also proving that it hasn't forgotten the people who bought its fire-prone smartphone in 2016. In the US, if you owned a Galaxy Note7, you'll be able to get a discount on the new Note8. A pretty significant discount, actually - up to $425. You will need to trade in your current phone for this to work, though. The deal will be available through Samsung's own online store for the US. If your existing phone will be valued at the top tier, the Note8 will definitely be much more affordable for you than for anyone else. Its full retail pricing is $930 to $960 depending on where you purchase from. So this is a nice gesture towards the die-hard fans of the Note line who, despite having been burned (yes, sometimes literally) by the previous member of the series, are willing to give the new Note a chance too. To learn more about the Note8, make sure you read our hands-on impressions . Also check out these camera samples from Samsung's first ever dual rear setup, and the full pricing and availability details for the handset. Source So.. discrimination much?

    "content": "Login Vlad 23 August 2017 Samsung Android Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that today Samsung took the wraps off its latest flagship smartphone , the Galaxy Note8 . We assume you've read all about it in our hands-on review , but if that didn't manage to quench your thirst for Note8-related information, Samsung itself is here to help. The Korean company has already uploaded two official promo videos for the device to its YouTube channel. The first one is around three minutes long and serves to introduce you to the phone.  The other video is basically the first 30-second TV ad for the Ntoe8. Expect this to air on a TV station near you, especially if you're in the US.  Next up, the company published an infographic that details all the things you can do with the Note8's S Pen, including creating 'live messages' and coloring. Here it is in all its glory: That's not the only Note-related infographic from Samsung, though. The next one reveals some key traits of people who have owned Note devices in the past. This serves to explain why the Note series is still a thing, distinct from the S line, we assume. Finally through another post the company explores why people are loyal to the Galaxy Note, concluding that the \"unique union of screen size, productivity and creativity\" is what \"continues to drive loyalty amongst Note users\". Multitasking is also important to Note users, who are more likely to be 'tech savvy' and take an active interest in technology and electronics. If you've come this far and are surprised by the fact that the word \"millennials\" hasn't been mentioned once, this is for you: Samsung says \"Note owners are 9 percentage points more likely than other smartphone users to say that their phone allows them to express their personal style, and this sentiment was especially strong amongst millennials\". Source 1 | Source 2 | Source 3 it's because they are 2 different audiences, 79% of users who actually owned a note said that but the remaining 21% who also owned one didn't.  \r\nThen people who don't own a note are the second audience. Get it? I can see Apple Marketing department shares tears watching this video, I mean starting since S7, Samsung ads just destroys competition, especially apple ads, which became very lame recently. If we talk only about phone, I think, there is no competiti... Nice promo materials.

    "content": "Login Vlad 23 August 2017 Samsung Android T-Mobile It's Galaxy Note8 day today, which means you probably won't mind yet another article about Samsung's much anticipated phablet. We've already covered the announcement , we've given you the pricing details , we've showed you the first camera samples as well as Samsung's official promo videos and infographics , we've published our hands-on impressions of the device... So what's next? T-Mobile is among the (many) US carriers that will offer the Galaxy Note8 come September 15, but this company has a history of creating some pretty extravagant unboxing videos for new smartphones. And sure enough, it's already got the Note8 unboxing up on its YouTube channel.  Disappointingly, this video doesn't feature any sharks - nor is it wholly shot underwater or at 10,000 feet . It just includes a lot of drawing and writing on a whiteboard with different colored markers. We assume that was somehow meant to make you think of the Note8's S Pen, but truth be told you can't really beat sharks when it comes to eccentric tech videos. Seriously, What a great ad. My god, both the video and the guy are annoying! x) Phone finder All brands Rumor mill Home News Reviews Compare Coverage Glossary FAQ RSS Youtube Instagram TikTok Facebook Twitter © 2000-2025 GSMArena.com Mobile version Android app Tools Contact us Merch store Privacy Terms of use Change Ad Consent Do not sell my data",
